##Week 3 Day 4 ABSTRACT INTERFACES

#Polymorphism
 - Polymorphism means many forms, an ability of a variable, methods or object to take on many forms, happens through inheritance
 - Inheritance lets variables and methods be used by a child class.
 - 3 forms:
> Method overriding
> Implementation of abstract methods of abstract class
> Implementation of abstracts methods of an interface

#Abstraction
**What it is**
 - Abstraction is about hiding unwanted details while showing most essential info
 - seperating the implementation from the declaration 
 - impletented in java by:
> - through abstract methods
> - through abstract classes and interfaces
> - abstract keyword is a non access modifier, used for classes and methods

**Abstract methods**
 - Abstract variables don't exist, closest is non initialized variable
 - regular variables can exist in abstract classes
 - declare a method abstract by using <abstract> in front of the method
 - Abstract method has no implementation body
 - The implementation is provided by child class
 - Abstract methods cannot be final because final cant be overridden.
 - cant be private, generates compiler error.

**Abstract Classes**
 - can have bot abstract and non abstract methods
 - cannot be instantiated
 - Declared with abstract keyword
 - can be <extends> by another class to provide logic to abstract methods
 - Classes extending abstract classes must provide logic to every abstract method, must be substituted wherver the abstract class is needed
 - Allows coder to only see essential methods

**Why use abstraction**
 - keeps methods youre using in outside classes down to a minimum
 - prevents confusion from other programmers
 - keeps code clean and readable
 - Reduces the code to be written
 - Provides a basic structure for each implementing classes

**Interfaces**
 - Only contains abstract methods and final variables (dont need to declare abstract and final here)
 - Cannot be instantiated
 - Cannot have constructors because we can't instantiate them (Besides implementation)
 - Can be implemented by other classes with implements
 - declared by using keyword interface
 - Variables are by default public, static, final
 - methods are public and abstract
 - an interface cant extend a class but it can extend other interfaces
 - Classes implementing interfaces must: provide logic for every method, must be subsituted whenever the interface is needed.

**Abstract Class vs Interface**
 - Use abstract classe when:
> The logic for some methods will always be the same in child classes
> you create a logic that will be useful to all child classes
> you want to create variables that all child classes will use and set values for

 - use interface when:
> you want to create structure only
> the only variables you need in all child classes will have constant values

 - You can use a abstract class that implements interface
