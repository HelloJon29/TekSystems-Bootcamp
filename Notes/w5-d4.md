# Lifecycle Operations
 - Session interface provides methods for lifecycle operations
 - Saving objects
 - Loading objects
 - getting objects
 - refreshing objects
 - updating objects
 - deleting objects
 - replicating objects
 - result of lifecycle operations affect the instance state

**Saving Objects**
 - An object remains in transient state until it is saved and moved into persistent state, it will be managed by a Session
 - EX:
> Person person = new Person(); create new obj, starts transient state
> person.setName("sang"); 
> session.save(person); once managed by session obj it now becomes persistent state

**Loading Objects**
 - load() is used to load objects from the database
 - each load() requires objects primary key as an identifier
 - the id must be Serializable - any primitive id must be converted to object
 - must have domain class or entity name to find the object with id
 - the returned object, returned as Object type, needs to be type casted to a domain class
 - the returned object is persistent
 - EX:
> public Object load(Class c, Serializable id);

**Get Objects**
 - works like load()
 - Only use load() if you are sure that the object exists, load() will throw an exception
 - Use get() if you are not sure it exists, it will return null if an id is not found
 - Person person = (Person) session.get(Person.class, id)

**Refresh objects**
 - Used to refresh objects from database representations where a persistent object may not be in sync with the database
 - public void refresh(Object object)

**Updating objects**
 - Hibernate (Session) automatically manages any changes made to the persistent objects
 - If a field changes on a persistent object, Hibernate Session will perform the change in the database when the transaction is committed (possibly by queuing session first)
 - You can force hibernate to commit all changes using flush()
 - can determine if the session is dirty(non committed changes) isDirty()

**Merging**
 - Copy the state of given object onto the persistent object with the same identifier
 - if there is no persistent instance currently associated with the session it will be loaded
 - Return the persistent instance, if the given instance is unsaved save a copy of and return it as a newly persistent instance
 - the given instance does not become associated with the session

# Hibernate Query Object and Hibernate Query Language
 - The hibernate Query Object is used to retireve data from the database.
 - HQL syntax is similar to database SQL language. The difference is that HQL uses CLass name instead of table nam, and property/field names instead of column names
 - Keywords such as SELECT FROM AND WHERE are not case sensitive but properties such as table and column names are case sensitive
 - from Employee is the same as select * from employee

# HQL - Query Interface
 - Query is an interface that is inside of org.hibernate.package
 - A query instance is obtained by calling Session.createQuery()
 - Query objects use SQL or HQL strings to retrieve data from the database and create objects.
 - A query instance is used to bind query parameters, limit the number of results, execute query
 - Hibernate provides different techniques to query database, TypeQuery,NamedQuery and Criteria API
 - TypeQuery and NamedQuery are sub types of Query

# HQL Clauses
 - FROM works like select
 - WHERE
 - ORDER BY
 - GROUP BY

# HQL Parameterized Query
**Named Parameters**
 - Hibernate supports named parameters:
> String hql = "FROM User u WHERE u.id = :id";
> Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
> query.setParameter("id",2);
> List results = query.list();

**Named Query**
 - annotated with @NamedQuery
> @NamedQueries() {
> @NamedQuery(name = "updateEmpById", query = "UPDATE Employee set Name = :name where id = :id")
> }

# Diff between JDBC and Hibernate
 - Hibernate performs an object relational mapping framework, while JDBC is simply a database connectivity API
 - With JDBC you need to write database specific SQL statements, JPA allows you to avoid that by expressing queries in terms of the java entities
 - JDBC is database dependent, Hibernate is independent allowing multi platform function
