##Week 4 Day 1

## Casting Slide

#Casting

**Type Cast**
 - Casting is the temp conversion of a value from its original data type to a different data type
 - Moving from a less inclusive data type to a more inclusive type (from a child object to a parent object) is automatic.
 - ex:
> Number n = new integer(1);
> StudentI student = new Student();

 - Boxing is about wrapping a primitive data type inside of an object, Casting is about converting from one type of object to another
 - Casting from a more inclusive type to a less inclusive type is not automatic and requires you to specify what you'd like to cast to

#Generics
**Generics**
 - Java Generics allows the creation of a single class, interface, and method that can be used with different types of data(Objects). 
 - Does not work with Primitive types
 - Generics mean parameterized types.the idea is to allow type to be a parameter to methods, classes and interfaces.
 - An entity(Object) such as a class, interface or method that operates on a parameterized type is called **generic entity**
 - Declared with <T> where a data type would original be
> public <T> myType;
> public getMyType(){
> return myType;
> }

 - To create Generic Class
> public class Box <T> {
> }
 - To implement a Generic Class same as non generic declared with the <T>
> MyClass <type> class1 = new MyClass <type>();

 - You can limit the data types that can be used with generic methods by specifying a class or interface that they should extend. NOTE you should still use extends in this case even if its an interface.
 - EX:
> public < T extends Student> {}

#Variable Args
**Variable Arguments**
 - Variable Arguments **(varargs)** allow you to take in any number of arguments of a given data type. It will treat these arguments as an array.
 - Declare vararg by putting 3 dots in front of the variable name:
> public void printLines(int ...a) {
>    for(int i: a) {
>       System.out.println(i);
>    }
> }

 - Each method can only have one varagrs parameter
 - The varargs argument must be the last parameter
 - call varargs normally except use commas for seperating multuple arguments

#Enum

**Enumerations**
 - Enums are small classes that contain a set of constant values, and can be declared either inside or outside of a class
 - Enums cannot be declared inside of a method
> ex enum:
> enum Days {
>     Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
> }
 - call this like a methods:
> Days monday = Days.Monday;

**Nested Class**
 - Just like a class can contain methods and variables, classes can also contain more classes:
 - if the inner class is static, we call it a nested class (static means you dont have to instantiate)
 - if the inner class is not static we call it inner class (must be instantiated)
 - The nested/inner class behaves just like any other class
 - Static nested class can't use the field specified by outer class

## Exception Handling Slide

**Java exception overview**
 - an exception is an event or abnormal condition that may happen at runtime and disrupts the normal flow of the program. We can handle the exceptions in order to ensure our code gets executed normally
 - Exception Handling in java helps minimizing exceptions and helps in recovering from exceptions. 
 - exception handling helps in maintaining the flow of the program
 - it is an **object** which is thrown at runtime

**Advantages of exception handling**
 - Can separate the error handling code from normal code
 - Can differentiate the error types
 - Normal flow of program can be maintained

**Categories of Exception**
 - Checked aka IOException
>  - 1. Exceptions that are checked at compile time, the programmer is prompted to handle these exception
>  - 2. Forces you to either use a try-catch or throws a keyword.
>  - 3. All exceptions are checked exceptions except ERROR, Uncheck Exception (Runtime Exception), and their subclasses.
 - Unchecked also called Runtime Exception:
>  - 1. Checked at run-time, happens due to a programming error
>  - 2. Use either try-catch or throws keyword.
>  - 3. RuntimeException and their subclasses are unchecked.
 - Error:
>  - 1. error is irrecoverable.
>  - 2. includes OutOfMemoryError,VirtualMachineError,AssertionError

**Difference between error and exception**
 - Error indicates that something severe has gone wrong. Not handled by programmer
 - Exceptions events occur in the code and can be handled by programmers
>  - NullPointerException
>  - ArithmeticException
>  - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

**Exception Hierarchy**
 - Throwable: the root class
 - Error: subclass of throwable
 - Exception: subclass of throwable

**Exception Handling Keywords**
 - try
 - catch
 - finally
 - throws mainly for checked
 - throw manually throw exceptions

**Accounting for exceptions**
 - Throw an exception
 - if an exception is thrown in the main method it will crash when it errors
 - Catch exception
 - when an error occurs we code to do something

**Exception Message**
 - Each exception contains a message at the level it was thrown. This message containts what happened, and identifies the line it happened.
 - To view all of the messages from every level, use printStackTrace()

**Try-Catch**
 - the **try** block contains the code you would like to try and run
 - the **catch** block contains the code you would like to execute if an error occurs
 - **Finally** block contains all the crucial statements that mus be executed whether exception occurs or not
 - the statements in this block will always execute regardless of whether exception occurs in try block or not such as closing a connection, stream etc.

**Catch exception**
 - You can catch on 2 different levels:
>  - The exact exception : FileNotFoundException
>  - a parent exception: IOException
 - The parent of all Exceptions is called Exception
>  - if you would like to catch all exceptions this can be used
>  - this makes things easier to code bu also harder to pinpoint the reason behind the exception
**Throw exception**
 - you can add your own message to the exception Stack
> catch(FileNotFoundException e)
> {
>    throw new exception("Error in Student.main() : File not found!");
> }

**Custom exceptions**
 - create a class that extends Exception
 - categorize exceptions by Reason
 - Categorize exceptions by Priority
 - Categorize exceptions by Module
 - after creating a custom exception, you can throw it the same way as others
