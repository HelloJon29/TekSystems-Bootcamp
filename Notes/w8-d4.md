### Week 8 Day 4

### Spring MVC CONT

## more Baeldung spring notes

# Exercises
 - @Controller tells spring that the class is a controller
 - Controllers will have annotations called handlers, which interact with the view
 - @GetMapping is one of them
 - To use thymeleaf you need to put xmlns:th="thymeleaf.org" in the html tag then use the th prefix

## SPRING MVC sang slides

# What does a Controller do
 - Controller has a set of handlers(handler methods) HTTP request is mapped to a handler of a controller
 - Controller delegates business logic to service level of code
 - Services is annotated with @Service and DAO classes are with @Repository

# @RequestMapping
 - RequestMapping annotation is used to map a url to a handler method of Controller
 - Can be specified at Class or method level
 - url specified at the method level, makes the annotation relative to the one specified at the class level
 - RequestMapping can be shortened to GetMapping, PostMapping, PutMapping, DeleteMapping etc

# Implicit Model as a Handle Argument
 - Spring MVC creates an empty model object and passes it to a handler method as an argument
 - you can then add attributes to the model in the form of key/value pairs
 - The model object is then exposed to the view(jsp, thymeleaf pages)
 - view can access model attributes using expression language(EL)

# Return Types
 - ModelAndView object
 - String
 - void
