### Week 9 Day 1

### Spring

## fullstack exercise notes:

# repository
 - the repository class should extend JpaRepository and inherit all its methods
 - spring data auto commits transactions for us

# Service layer
 - use @Service to let spring know it is business logic code/ used on DaoImpl classes
 - it makes the class a bean

# Beans
 - Spring needs beans to be able to handle the classes
 - using an annotation on a class will make it a bean
 - the annotation comes from the @Component annotation

# Controller
 - Controller works in tandem with Thymeleaf
 - the controller will have annotations that link with the html elements in thymleaf
 - they perform an action and then return a string that is the html page that shows after the operation completes

## Spring Framework Dependency Injection
# What is DI
 - aka Inversion of Control, or Hollywood principle
 - DI Container: resolves dependencies of components by wiring/injecting dependency objects(push)
 - Target components are testable as POJOs
 - Target components are reusable and maintainable

# DI Configuration
 - DI container gets instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, inject, and assemble by reading configuration meta data
 - config data is a java class 
# 2 DI variants
**Constructor DI**
 - dependencies are injected through constructors of a component
**Setter DI**
 - dependencies are injected through setter methods of a component
# Reading Config
**Reading Java configuration file**
@Configuration
@Import(BeanConfiguration.class)
public class MainApplication {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// AnnotationConfigApplicationContext accepts annotated classes 
// as input - in particular @Configuration-annotated classes
ApplicationContext context 
= new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(MainApplication.class);
Person person = context.getBean(Person.class);
System.out.println(person.getName());
}
}
**Reading java configuration file with SpringBootClass**
@Configuration
@Import(BeanConfiguration.class)
public class MainApplication {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// SpringApplication bootstraps and launches a Spring application 
// from a Java main method
ApplicationContext context 
= SpringApplication.run(MainApplication.class, args);
Person person = context.getBean(Person.class);
System.out.println(person.getName());
}
}

# Beans
 - bean is used to refer to any component managed by spring
 - properties may be simple values or references to other beans
 - beans can have multiple names

# Autowired
 - @Autowired is used to specify DI

# autoscanning configuration
 - any bean annotated with @Component(generic annotation) will be auto-detected and spring will create their instances
 - no need for @Bean configuration for beans

## MVC, SPRING MVC Slide 1
# MVC
 - way to structure projects into seperate concerns
 - add modularity and encapsulation 
 - Model
 - View
 - Controller

# Spring Framework
**Web layer**
- Spring security
**Common Layer**

**Service Layer**

**Data Layer**
 - Spring Data

# Spring MVC
**Components**
 - DispatcherServlet
 - HandlerMapping
 - ViewResolver
 - HandlerAdapter
 - Model
 - View
 - Controller

**Request Life Cycle**
> request : Dispatcher Servlet : Handler, Controller(return ModelAndView), ViewResolver,View


# Spring boot
 - Spring got too complex
 - Spring boot simplifies launching a spring project
 -
