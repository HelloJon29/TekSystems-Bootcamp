### Week 7 Day 3

### Javascript

## Object Classes, FUnctions slide

# Intro to js Objects

 - js objects are dynamic
 - non primitive data type store multiple collections of data
 - all js values except primitive types are objects
 - you do not need to create a class to create objects in js
 - an Object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs
 - each key value pair represents a property and value
 - key can be a string and value can be any js value

**Methods**
 - A mehtod is defined as an object with a property of a function

**Creating Objects**
 - Define and create a single object by using an object literal
 - Define and create a single object with the keyword new, you must invoke the object with () after calling new
 - define an object constructor and then create objects of the constructed type using new
> ex:
> var point = { hello: 1, world: 2};
> with new:
> var x1 = new Object();

**Accessing properties**
 - call object and the property
 - person.firstName or person.["firstName"]
 - for in loop: block of code will be executed once for each property

**Delete Properties**
 - delete keyword
 - delete person.age
 - delete deletes a property from an object but not the object itself

# Arrays
 - create like this:
 - var empty = []
 - var fill = [1,2,3,4,5]
 - arrays can be filled with various contents, js autoassigns
 - can be multi dimensional 

## Sangs slides Inheritence with JS
# Prototype
 - Js is Prototype inheritance
 - no concept of class
 - injertance is provided through prototype property
 - the actual name of it is _proto_
 - prototype has a prototype itself creating a prototype chain till it reaches Object object, whis has a prototype of null
 - the way prototype enables inheritance is a search feature ex:
>  - If myObject has property a, it will access a right away
>  - if myObject doesn't have property b, it will trigger myObject to search the prototype chain for b, if one of the properties search is found in the chain it will return that value for myObject.b

 - In JS we want to construct inheritance for a group of objects
 - create a function constructor and have all objects inherit from that constructor
 - The constructor function acts as a super class that new objects created with it inherit directly from the constructor
 - this causes them to search for functions and properties from the constructor immediatley
