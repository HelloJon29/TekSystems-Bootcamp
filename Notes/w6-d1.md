### Week 6 Day 1

### TDD and H2

## H2

# H2 database

- h2 is a relational database management system written in Java. It can be embedded in apllications or run in the client server mode, but its not a persistent database
- It is an in memory database: In memory db is live only during the time of execution of the application because data will not persist on the disk
- Efficient way to learn a framework
- It is:
> - extremely fast, open source, jdbc api
> - available in embedded and server modes, in memory database
> - browser based console application

# What is in Memory Database
**Differences**
 - You don't have to Install DatabaseSetup and Setup Schema and tables

**Advantages**
 - Zero project setup or infastructure
 - Zero Configuration 
 - Zero Maintenance
 - Easy to use for Learning, POCs and Unit Tests
 - Spring Boot provides simple configuration to switch between a real database and an in memory database like H2
 - commands are similar to SQL

**Dependecy**
 - Must add maven dependency to Pom.xml and have h2 specific setup for hibernate.config

## Sangs Slides/ JUnit

# What is JUnit
 - Unit testing framework for java
 - De-facto standard for unit testing
 - Free and open sourced

# How to write Junit test
 - Create test class with test methods
 - each test method has a method signature
 - Annotate with @Test
>  - public
>  - void return type
>  - no arguments
>  - Add fixtures:
>  - @BeforeEach and @AfterEach to run before after each test method
>  - @BeforeAll and @Afterall to run once before/after all test methods
>  - @Disabled to temporarily ignore the testing

**Assert Statements from Junit 5**
 - Assertions start with assert
 - comparison between expected value and actual value
 - assertXXX(...,String message)
 - assertXXX(...,lambda)
 - assertEquals(expected,actual)

**Assertj**
 - fluent
 - more readable
 - default assertion package in spring boot
 - assertThat(result).isEqualTo(expected result)

**Exception Handling in Junit**
 - tests are either positive or negative
 - to test negative you check to see if code will throw an exception

**Parameterized Testing**
 - Used when we find ourselves writing identical tests where only a few data input values are different but the logic is the same
 - Annotate with @ParameterizedTest

# Test Code vs Production Code
 - Test code bcomes part of the codebase
 - it is backed up and put into a source code repository along with production code
 - Test code needs to be documented
 - Test code will not deploy with production

**Be thorough**
 - write tests for everything
 - except methods that are too simple to fail like getters and setters
 - Write multiple tests for each method
 - positive tests
 - negative tests
 - boundary value testing

# Characters of good tests
 - Runs fast, with short setup run time and teardown
 - Run in isolation
 - Use real data when possible
 - Repeatable

**Goals for well written tests**
 - Readable for others
 - Should serve as a sample client code for others
 - Should serve as a specification document
 - should test what theyre supposed to test and nothing more
 - not tightly coupled to the target code
 - Should follow good coding principles

# What is and why TDD
 - TDD relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle of Red, Green, Refactor
 - Requirements are turned into very specific test cases then the software is improved to pass the new tests only
 - This allows almost everything to be testable from the get go

# TDD development cycle
TDD Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor
 - Repeat Red Green Refactory cycle
 - Add failing test(red)
 - Write just enought and simplest possible code to correct the test (Green)
 - Refactor code(refactor)
 - For each cycle:
 - Prefer to add few lines of functional code, less than 10 before rerunning tests
 - Prefer to limit each TDD cycle to be less than 2 to 5 minutes

**Best practices**
 - Only specify what is important
 - Make small steps, solve simply, follow 2-5 min rule
 - Perform refactoring after each passing test, reduce technical debt
 - Make testing code expressive and readable 

**Anti Patterns**
 - The free ride: rather than write a new test method for another feature a new assertion rides along an existing test
 - The loud mouth: clutters up the console with diagnostic messgaes logging, other chatterm even when passing
 - The stranger: Test case that doesnt even belong in the unit tests its part of, its really testing a seperate object
 - The local hero: A test case that depends on something specific to the development environment passes on one machine fails on another

## Untestable Monoliths slide

# Untestable monolith
 - Monolithc structures can only be tested by running the entire application
 - monolithic structures often add implementation without adding behavior
 - Behaviors are independently testable units of code
 - TDD ensures behaviors are established prior to implementation thus enforcing the existence of a behavior
