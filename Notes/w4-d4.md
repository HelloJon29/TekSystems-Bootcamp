##Week 4 Day 4

## Collection Slide 1 CONT

#Stack

#Set
 - Set is a Collection with no duplicate elements or Every element of a set must be unique
 - the Set interface models the mathematical set abstraction
 - Set implementations all extend the AbstractSet class:
 - EnumSet<E>:
 - HashSet<E>:
 - TreeSet<>: 
 - Sets are used to find unique values

**Note about Concurrency**
 - None of the collection classes shown in Slide 1 are safe for multi threaded code if any of the threads modify the collection
 - the Collections class provides static methods that return thread safe wrapper to any of the collection types
**Static collections class**

## Lambda / Sangs Slides
**What is Lambda**
 - a formal system for expressing computational behaviour(parametrizing behavioud) through functions(function object)
 - function objects are first class citizens
>  - function Object can be assigned to a variable
>  - function object can be passed to a method as an argument(parameter)
>  - function object can be returned as a return value
 - Many languages support Lambda expression
 - Java 8 is when support for Lambda began

**Why Lambda**
 - Lets you declare what to do, not how to do it
>  - Cleaner, more concise, more expressive code
>  - High productivity flexible fluent style programming
 - Promotes immutability
>  - less concurrency issues
 - Enables parallel programming & lazy evaluation
>  - Higher performance
 - Forms the basis of functional programming paradigm
 - Makes many sets of problems easier to solve, results in cleaner code

**Concept and Implementation**
 - Lambda is a concept in many languages
 - In Java, lambda expression is implemented essentially as an anonymous function

**What is functional Interface**
 - A single regular Java interface with a single abstract method
 - common in java programs
 - aka Single Abstract Method (SAM)
 - Java interfaces can be used as a reference Type, type variable or argument. This means functional interface can be too

**FunctionInterface Annotation**
 - @FunctionalInterface
 - this helps you and the compiler know you want to make something a functional interface

**Where to use Lambda Expression in Java app**
 - Concept: you use expression wherver a functional behavior is required
 - Java app: You can use Lambda expression in any place where the functional interface type is expected
 - EX:
> @FunctionalInterface
> public interface Calc {
>     int calculate(int x, int y);
> }
> Calc multiply = (x,y) -> x*y;
> Calc divide = (x,y) -> x/y;

**Anonymous Inner Class and Lambda**
 - Given that typical usage of anonymous inner class is an example of an argument whose type is a functional interface
 - EX:
> // Anonymous Runnable
>  Runnable r1 = new Runnable() {
>   @Override
>   public void run() {
>      sout "Hellow world one";
>      }
>  };
>  r1.run();
> // Lambda Runnable
> Runnable r2 = () -> sout "Hellow world 2"
> r2.run();

**Lambda Expression Syntax**
 - General syntax:
> (argument list) -> {code block}

**Syntax can be simplified**
 - Type in argument list can be omitted
> - Java compiler already know the type
 - Single argument with no ()
>  - If there is a single argument, parentheses are optional
>  - Although no argument must have a ()
 - When body has only a single expression
 - When the code block has only a single expression, the value of the expression auto becomes the reutrn value
>  - do not need return statement or curly braces

## Functional Programming slide

#Advanced String Manipulation
**StringBuffer**
 - Peer class of String
 - Substrings inserted naywhere in the StringBugger
 - defualt capicty of 16
 - String plus 16 is the capacity
 - Constructors

**StringJoiner**
 - java.Util.class
 - COnstructs sequence of strings
>  - Delimiters Prefix and suffix

**Functional Interfaces**
 - There may be default and static methods in a Functional interface but only one abstract method
 - @FunctionalInterface is for the compiler to know you are in fact making it a FI and find issues

**Generic Functional Abstraction**
 - Methods work across types
 - compile time safety
 - Can combine type parameters with a functional interface

## Functional Interfaces provided by JDK / Sangs slide
**FI defined in Java 8**
 - Java 8 comes with a set of commonly used functional interfaces so you dont have to define your own
 - IntPredicate int  ->  boolean  .test();

**Generically Typed FI**
 - Supplier<T>
> - Supplier<T>  ()->  .get()
 - Consumer <T> BiConsumer<T, U>
> - Consumer<T>  () ->  .accept()
 - Function <T,R>
> - T -> R  .apply()
 - Predicate<T>
> - T ->  boolean  .test()

## Streams / Sangs Slide
**What is a Stream**
 - Wrappers around data sources (examples arrays or lists)
 - Stream does not store data itself
 - Stream carry values from data source through pipeline of operations
 - Streams only take Lambda expressions as arguments
 - Operations can be executed in sequence or in parallel
 - Support laziness, postpone operations until how much data is eventually needed

**Issues of Collections for processing**
 - You have to use a for or while loop to get the answer
 - Writing parallelizable code with collection is very hard

**parallelStream**
 - this will allow an operation to be done in parallel
 - it is another usage of stream

**Stream Ops**
 - Stream base processing is a pipe of operations
 - Pipe is made of multiple intermediate operations
 - Has a single terminal operation at the end
 - Intermediate operations: filter, map, sorted
 - Terminal Operations: count, sum, reduce, forEach,findFirst etc
