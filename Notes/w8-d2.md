### Week 8 Day 2

### Servlets

## Java Servlets sang slide

# What is Servlet
 - Java objects which are based on Servlet framework and APIs
 - Extends functionality of a http server for creating dynamic contents
 - Mapped to URLs and managed by container with a simple architecture
 - Available and running on all major web servers and app servers
 - platform and server independent

# Static vs Dynamic Contents
**Static contents**
 - typically static html page
 - same display for everyone

**Dynamic contents**
 - Contents is dynamically generated based on conditions
 - Conditions could be: User identity, Time of day, Entered values through forms and selections
 - Ex amazon page

# First servlet code
@WebServlet("/hello")
Public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, 
HttpServletResponse response){
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
out.println("<title>Hello World!</title>");
}
...
}

# What does servlet do
 - Receives client request(http request)
 - Extract info from requests
 - Performs business logic processing
 - Create and send response to client, or forward the request to another servelt or JSP page

# Requests and Responses
**Requests**
 - Info sent from clent to server
 - who made it
 - what user entered data is sent
 - which http headers are sent

**Response**
 - Info sent to client from a server
 - text or binary data
 - http headers cookies etc

# HTTp
 - Contains:
 - header
 - HTTP method: Get(input form data is passed as part of URL), Post(Input form data is passed within message body), Put(update or replace)
 - request data

**Get**
 - User entered info is appended to the URL in a query string
 - can only send limited amount of data as query params

**Post**
 - User entered info is sent as data(not appended to url)
 - can send any amount of data

# Servlet Interfaces & Classes
the hierarchy is:
 - Servlet.GenericServlet.HttpServlet(what we work with)
 - ServletRequest.HttpServletRequest
 - ServletResponse.HttpServletResponse
 - HttpSession

# Servlet Life Cycle methods
 - init()
 - destroy()
 - invoke both just once

Ex: 
@WebServlet(
urlPatterns = "/hello",
initParams = {
@WebInitParam(name = ”name", value = ”sang"),
@WebInitParam(name = ”time", value = ”Good morning")

 - service() javax.servlet.GenericServlet is abstract
 - service() javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet is concrete, do not override, dispatches doGet() doPost()
 - doGet(),doPost(), doXxx() HttpServlet override these

# Servlet Request Object
 - Contains data passed from client to servlet
 - All servlet requests implement ServletRequest interface which defines methods for accessing
 - Client sent parameters
 - object valued attributes
 - locales
 - clent and server
 - input stream
 - protocol info
 - content type
 - If request is made over secure channel https or not
 - getParameter used to get info through forms from html

**Who Set Object value Attributes**
 - Request attributes can be set in two ways
 - Servlet container itself might set attributes to make available custom info about a request
 - Servlet set application-specific attribute
 - Locale is set by the browser itself

**Get client info**
 - Servlet can get client info from the request
 - String request.getRemoteAddr() gets client ip address
 - String request.getRemoteHost() get client host name

**Get Server info**
 - String request.getServerName() gets url name
 - int request.getServerPort() gets port number ex 8080

## Into to Servlet Slides

# Server-Side Web Tech
 - Process based
 - thread based

# Web terminology
 - Website Static vs Dynamic
 - HTTP
 - HTTP Requests
 - Get and Post
 - Container
 - Server Web vs Application
 - Content Type

# HTTP Request Methods
 - GET
 - POST
 - HEAD
 - TRACE
 - PUT
 - DELETE
 - OPTIONS

# Content Type (MIME)
 - AKA Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension MIME
 - a HTTP header the provides description about what you are sending to the browser

# Servlet Life cycle
 - Load Servlet classes
 - Creating an instance of Servlet
 - Invoke init() once
 - Invoke service() repeatedly for each client request
 - Invoke destroy() for cleanup

#sendRediret()
 - used for redirecting requests and response objects to a different url
 - HTTPServletResponse response.sendRedirect('URL')

# Apache Tomcat
 - Open source java-based web server software. Tomcat is a container for apps built using html/servlet and JSP tech
