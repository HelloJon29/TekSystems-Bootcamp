##Week 4 Day 5

## Collections Sangs SLides
#Benefits
 - Reduces programming effort, dont have to create own scheme
 - Increases program speed and quality
 - Allows interoperability among unrealated APIs
 - Fosters software reuse

**Java Collection Interfaces**
 - Allow collections to be manipulated independently of the implementation details of their representation

**Interfaces**
 - Set - HashSet - TreeSet - LinkedHashSet
 - List - ArrayList - LinkedList
 - Queue
 - Map - HashMap - TreeMap - LinkedHashMap

**Add and Reomove methods of Collection**
 - .add()
 - .remove()

**Iterator**
 - hasNext()
 - next()
 - remove()
#Set
**Set**
 - A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements
 - equals hashCode opersations

**Implementations of Set (These are all objects)**
 - HashSet O(1) no ordering guarantees
>  - Caveats: Choosing initial capacity thats too high can waste bot space and time
>  - too low wastes time by copying data structure each time its forced to increase capacity
 - TreeSet: SortedSet Interface, natural ordering by values, only unique values
 - LinkedHashSet: Insertions ordering, only unique values

**Synchronized Access to Set Object**
 - HashSet,TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet are not synchronized
 - Collections.synchronizedSet() method will allow synchro to avoid collision when wrapping a SetObject

**SortedSet**
 - order is defined through natural ordering by default, can introduce custom **comparator**
 - Several additional operations are provided to take advantage of ordering
>  - comparator() returns the comparator associated with this sorted set, or null if it uses its elements natural ordering.
>  - first() returns the first (lowest) element currently in this sorted set
>  - last() returns the last (highest) element currently in this sorted set

**Natural Ordering in Java**
 - A class is said to have a natural ordering if it has implemented java.lang.Comparable interface
>  - the compareTo() of Comparable interface is referred to as its natural comparasion method
 - Examples String, Date, Integer
 - Example natural ordering:
>  - String is alphabetical order
>  - Date chronological order
>  - Integer numerical order
#List
**List Interface**
 - An ordered collection (sometimes called a sequence)
 - Lists can contain duplicate elements (as opposed to set which does not allow duplicate elements
 - the user of List has precise control over where each element is inserted in the list and can access elements by integer **index**.
 - Additional Operations supported by List:
>  - Positional access: manipulates elements based on their numerical position in the list
>  - Search: searches for a specified object in the list and returns its numerical position
>  - Iteration: extends Iterator semantics to take advantage of the lists sequential nature
>  - Range-view: performs arbitrary range operations on the list
**Operations of List**
public interface List<E> extends Collection<E> {
// Positional access
E get(int index);
E set(int index, E element); 
boolean add(E element); 
void add(int index, E element); 
E remove(int index); 
boolean addAll(int index, Collection<? extends E> c); 

 - Search
> int indexOf(Object o);
> int lastIndexOf(Object o); // Returns the index in this list of the last occurrence of the
// specified element, or -1 if this list does not contain this element.

// Iteration
> ListIterator<E> listIterator();
> ListIterator<E> listIterator(int index);

 - Range-view
>List<E> subList(int from, int to);

**Implementations of List**

**ArrayList:**
 - Resizable array implementation of the List interface
 - offers O(1) positional access
 - ArrayList has a capacity
 - 
**LinkedList**
 - Offers O(1) for insertions or removals
 - Not a good choice for random access

**Synchro**
 - neither ArrayList or LinkedList are synchronized

#Collections Utility Class
 - Provides methods to return an instance of an empty Set,List, Map - emptySet,emptyList,emptymap
 - Collections.sort(i);
 - Collections.shuffle(i);
