## Week 5 Day 1

## Basic IO

# Java IO
 - the api that come with java which targets reading and writing data
 - Located in the Java IO package (java.io).

**Streams overview**
 - Io streams are conceptually endless flow of data. You can either read from a stream or write to a stream. a stream is connected to a data source or a data destination
 - Streams in java IO can be either byte based or character based
 - Byte based: uses abstract classes InPutStream and OutPutStream
 - Character based: uses abstract classes Reader and Writer
 - byte stream access the file byte by byte
 - Java programs use byte streams to perfom input and output of 8-bit bytes
 - Byte streams are not character encoded

**Stream**
 - InputStream
 - OutputStream

**Character bases Stream**
 - a buffer is esentially a block of memory into which you can write data
 - BufferedReader: class is used to read the text from a character based input stream. reads data line by line with readLine(). Inherits Reader Class
 - FileWriter, PrintWriter also do this

**Byte based Stream**
 - FileInputStream: built ion class that reads data from a file byte by byte with read() method
 - FileOutputStream: built in class that writes data to a file byte by byte with the write() method.
 - If you want to read a binary file or txt containing special characters you want to use FileInputStream instead of FileReader

**Scanner**
 - can pass System.In to take input stream
 - Read next data type use nextInt() or something
 - to read strings use nextLine()

## JDBC

**What is JDBC**
 - Application Programming Interface (API)
 - JDBC is an API that manages connections to a database issuing queries and commands, and handles result sets obtained from the database
 - API is Javas solution to problems
>  - Initial connection
>  - querying SQL
>  - Inserting, updating, deleting data DML
>  - Creating Updating and deleting tables DDL
 - Solutions for a Database:
>  - Create an API that lets your code access the database through loops automatically
>  - 1. no human error
>  - 2. very scalable
>  - Store program data in a database:
>  - 1. efficient searches due to querying and indexing
>  - 2. Robust security features
>  - 3. single record updating ability

#Connectivity with JDBC
**Register database Driver:**
 - JDBC includes a DriverManager class: a software component that is required by the JDBC API to interact with the database.
>  - Allows you to setup a driver
>  - Driver allows you to connect
>  - All other JDBC objects use this driver
 - Registering a driver - Method 1:
>  - public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
>  -     DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver());
>  - }
 - Method 2:
>  - Class.forName("org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver") this is a string literal not advised for runtime errors

**Connecting to Database**
 - Connection class: a Java object that represents a unique connection to a db. 
>  - Allows storing Database Connection as variable
>  - Connection created via DriverManager
 - DriverManager.getConnection(pass variables here);

**Sending SQL to the Database**
 - JDBC Statement: A java object that can be used to execute either database queries or database updates when using JDBC
 - JDBC uses a Statement class for queries:
>  - Created by the Connection class
>  - Connected made by DriverManager
 - Creating a Statement and executing query:
> String SelectSQL = "Select * FROM employees";
> Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
> ResultSet result =  stmt.executeQuery(SelectSQL);

**Response from the Database**
 - When you query the database you get JDBC ResultSet class back
 - Returned from Statement.executeQuery()
 - Lists output data
 - seperated into columns
 - Can loop through data with ResultSet.next();
 - ResultSet.get<Type>()
>  - 1. Use column number Starts at 1
>  - 2. Use column header
>  - 3. Replace Type with actual type

**Close Connection**
 - connetion.close();
 - prevent memory leak 
 - stop connection when user finishes using program
 - prevent crash and slowdowns
# Statements
**Prepared Statements**
 - Easier to set SQL parameter values
 - Accepts query in constructor
 - prevents against SQL dependency injection attacks
 - Improves app performance
 - pre compiles sql statements
 - ex:
> String query = "select * from employees where officeCode = ? OR officeCode = ? OR officeCode = ? ORDER BY officeCODE";
>         PreparedStatement preparedStatement = conn.prepareStatement(query);
>         preparedStatement.setInt(1, 1);
>         preparedStatement.setInt(2, 4);
>         preparedStatement.setInt(3, 6);
>         ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
>         while (resultSet.next()) {
>             String name = resultSet.getString("firstName");
>             String lastName = resultSet.getString("lastName");
>             String office = resultSet.getString("officeCode");
>             System.out.println(name + " | " + lastName + " | " + office);
>         }

## Applying OOP to JDBC

# old process
**Repeat for every DAO**
 - Register Driver: same every time
 - Connect to DB: Same every time
 - Prepare Statement
 - Execute Statement
 - Obtain data from Database
 - Close the connection: same

# new process
 - AbstractDAO:
>  - register driver
>  - connect to database
>  - safely close connection

 - Create Interface for each DAO
>  - contains queries
>  - creates structure for methods
 - Implement DAO:
>  - Write logic for interface methods
>  - start with register/connect method
>  - end with .close()

# AbstracDAO
 - set private final String variables for url user password and driver
 - set protected Connection PreparedStatement and ResutlSet objects
 - implement a connect method within the AbstractDAO
 - also implement a closing method
# DAO interfaces
 - store queries here (can be enum)
 - methods for the query

# Using enums to store queries

# Implementing a DAO
 - extends Abstract Class and implements Interface
 - starts and ends with methods from the Abstract
 - Each implemented method uses a query from the interface
