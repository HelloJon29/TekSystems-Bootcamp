##Week 4 Day 2

## Interface cont()
**Multiple Interfaces**
 - A concrete class can only extend 1 super class
 - A class can however, implement multiple interfaces seperated by commas
> public class MyClass implements interface1,interface2,interface3 ()

 - Interfaces are not part of the class hierarchy
 - interfaces can have inheritance among themselves with extends
 - If you introduce a new abstract method to an interface all other classes implementing it will break
 - Create a new interface is one way to solve the issue
 - Solution 2 is to create a child interface that extends the old one and has the new code

## Exception Cont()
 - to create custom exceptions you extends Runtime Exception to create unchecked

**Using Interface as an argument**
 - you can use an interface as an argument to limit what is inputed in a method
 - this is also a form of polymorphism 
 - any Class that implements the interface can be used as a passed through input for that method

## Core Java Files and Storage

**Java IO package**
 - the Java IO package is primarily focused on input and output to files, network streams, internal memory buffers.
 - The IO package is for reading raw data from a source and writing raw data to a destination.
 - files, pipes, network connections, in memory buffers(arrays), System.in

**File Class**
 - File class is used to perform various operations on files and directories
 - a file is a named location that can be used to store related info
 - directory is a collection of files and subdirectories
 - Create an object of file:
> File file = new File(String pathName);

# READ FILE
**Reading a File**
 - 1 way is to use Scanner
 - you need to account for exceptions
 - to read through a whole file just add a loop
> while(input.hasNextLine()) {
>     data += input.nextLine();
> }

 - you can store each line in an array or ArrayList with a while and enhanced for loop
**Read Delmited File**
 - delimiter seperates a file in columns and rows
 - CSV comma separated values file splits strings by commas
 - The workflow:
> - read a line then split by the delimiter
> - store that line in a array
> - place the array into an ArrayList

**The process overall**
 - Create an object type of File, set the path
 - Create an object of Scanner, set to the file
 - Use nextLine() to read a line
 - split the line by the delimiter being used(optional)
 - Store the lines in an Array or ArrayList for further use

#WRITE FILE
**Writing text to a File**
 - 1 way is with FileWriter class.
 - When instantiating FileWriter you need to pass 2 parameters:
>  - the file object you are writing to
>  - A boolean determing if you should write over or append to a file
>  FileWriter myWriter = new FileWriter(file, true);
 - FileWriter will create the file if it does not exist
 - FileWriter has write(char[]) method which can write an array of characters to the destination the FileWriter is connected to.
 - write(char[]) returns the number of characters written to the FileWriter
 - make sure to .close() the writer to flush it
 - you can create new lines mannually with escape \n

**Writing to a Delimited File**
 - you just write() using the delimiter within the arguments

## Advanced Java Java Collections Framework

#The Java Collections Framework JCF
 - the JCF defines interfaces and classes, which implement the interfaces using a variety of data structures plus algorithms for using those data structures
 - the primary interfaces from JCF are Collection and Map
 - Collection interface defines methods for:
> - adding and removing elements or clearing the collection
> - Iterating through all members of the collection
> - testing whether the collection contains a value
> - Converting the collection to an array

 - The Map interface represents a mapping from keys to values, it defines methods for:
>  - adding key/value pair(s)
>  - testing whether a key or value is present
>  - Viewing the keys, values, or key/value pairs as a Collection
>  Map super interface, navigatable map, sorted map

**Collection**
 - The JCF defines several interfaces which extend Collection:
 - Set: a set contains no duplicate elements: with 2 subinterfaces
>  - SortedSet extends set and add the requirement that elements are ordered
>  - NavigableSet extends set and adds operations for fuzzy comparisons
 - Queue: a Queue is designed to hold elements for future processing
>  - Queues are FIFO
>  - Some Java queues are LIFO, these are called Stacks
>  - Deque is a double ended queue that support insertion/removal at both ends
# Generic Classes and Interfaces
 - <E> is a placeholder that can be subsituted for any type
 - <T> is similar
 - ArrayList<String> for example
 - cannot use primitive as a type for generics
**Parameters**
 - you can use any variable you want but there are naming conventions
 - unlike variable names, parameters should be short and Capitalized so they dont get confused with variable or class names
 - ex:
>  - E, K, N, V, T
 - you can have more than one type parameter:
> Map<K, V> {}

**Generic Type Constraints**
 - you can create a type constraint by specifying what the generic type extends:
 - <T extends Number>

#ArrayList
**Dynamic Array**
 - Arrays cannot be resized once they have been created
 - To get around this we implement DynamicArray<E>
 - ArrayList<E> implements a dynamic array
 - ArrayList<E> implements Collection<E>
 - Collection<E> extends Iterable<E>
**ArrayList Constructors**
 - Default Constructor: Creates an ArrayList with default capacity which is 10
 - Capacity constructor
 - Populating Constructor
**Common ArrayList methods**
- add(E e)
- indexOf
- contains
- remove(E e)
- remove(int index)
**Interating with ArrayList**
 - You can use ArrayList in enhanced for loops because it implements Collection which extends Iterable
 - you can use them in standard for loops too
 - size() gives the maximum index
 - get(int index) returns the value at the given index
 - set(int index, E value) sets the value at the given index

**ArrayList.sort()**
 - the full signature is public void sort(Comparator<? super E> c)
 - to sort an ArrayList you must provide a Comparator, a method which takes 2 arguments of type E(or subclass of E) and returns an integer indicating  which 1st argument is (-1), equal to (0) or greater than (1) the 2nd arg
 - Comparator is a fuctional interface so it can be used with lambda expressions
**ArrayList Code**
 - the Arrays class provides shortcuts for initializing an ArrayList
> List<Integer> iList1 = Arrays.asList(3,4,6,7,9,12,15,17,23);

**ArrayList others**
 - ArrayList allows duplicate values
 - ArrayList allows null values
 - ArrayList implements additional interfaces
>  - List
>  - Serializable
>  - Cloneable
>  - RandomAccess

#LinkedList
**What they are**
 - A linked list is a data structure with nodes chained together via link
 - May be either singularly linked list or doubly linked list
 - doubly can be traversed in either direction
**adding a Node**
**Removing Node**
**Implementing Contains**
**traversing the linked list**

**Constructors**
 - LinkedList<Integer> 11 = new LinkedList<Integer>(); // creates empty linked list
 - LinkedList<Integer> 11 = new LinkedList<>(c); // c is collection of Integer, creates a linked list containing all elements of c, ordered by the collections iterator. same order as enhanced for loop

**Interfaces**
 - List < Collection < Iterable
 - Deque < Queue 
 - Cloneable
 - Serializable

**Applications**
 - Natural choice for applications and involve previous/next behaviour:
>  - browser navigation
>  - music players
>  - image carousel
 - Some OS utilize linked lists for Free-memory management
 - Some hash table implementations use linked lists for collision resolution
