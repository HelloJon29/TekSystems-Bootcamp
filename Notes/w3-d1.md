##Week 3 Day 1 JAVA - Mathematical Functions, Characters, and Strings

# Wrapper
**Wrapper Classes**
 - Primitive types are not objects and don't have methods
 - Wrapper Classes are made for each primitive type
 - Wrappers are objects that encapsulate the primitives
 - Auto-boxing: primitive values are automatically converted to the matching wrapper type
 - Un-boxing: converting an object of a wrapper type to the corresponding primitive
 - They are capitalized fulle word versions of the primitave, int = Integer ex

**Casting**
**Character Class**

# Math Module
**Math Class**
 - provies functions for common mathematical functions including:
 - Constants : pi, e
 - Functions: trigonometric methods
 - exponential methods
 - rounding methods
 - min,max,abs and random methods

**Rounding Methods**
> double ceil(double x)
> double floor(double x)
> double rint(double x)
> int round(float x)
> long round(double x)

**Random Method**
 - Math.random() generates a random double value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0 end exclusive 
# Character Types

#Strings
**String Class**
 - String is a sequence of characters
 - String is immutable. you cant change the object itself but you can change the reference to the object
>  - String s1 = "welcome"; using variable and literal
>  - String s = new String("welcome"); creating 2 objects and one reference variable, this stores the object into heap, and the literal into string constant pool
 - Some methods
>  - x.length()
>  - x.charAt()
>  - x.toLowerCase()
>  - x.toUpperCase()
>  - x.trim()
>  - equals(x)
>  - equalsIgnoreCase(x)
>  - compareTo(x)
>  compareToIgnoreCase(x)
>  startsWith(prefix)
>  endsWith(suffix)
>  x.substring(beginIndex,EndIndex) if you provide only 1 value it reads all from that index position onwards
#System.out.prinf()
 - System.out.printf(format pattern, items);
 - format is a string that may consist of substring and format specifiers
 - Format specifier specifies how an item should be displayed:
>  - %b boolean
>  - %c char
>  - %d integer
>  - %f floating point value, for double and float
>  - %e a number in standard scientific notation
>  - %s a string value
 - an item may be numeric,char,boolean,string, or other types
 - 
# Methods
**Class**
 - You can call from a class and use that method without an object, static
> String.format();
> System.out.println();
> Integer.parseInt(string); to convert to primitive data type
> Integer.valueOf(string); to convert to reference type
**Object**
 - This is invoked through an object, instanced
> string lcMessage =message.toLowerCase();
> > Big example: Scanner
> Scanner input = new Scanner();

**Conversion from number to String**
 - toString() an inbuilt method in Java that returns the value given to it in String format> the return is a string object.
 - 2 implemementations:
>  - instanced x.toString(); (println actually does this behind the scene)
>  - static Integer.toString(x);

## Conditional Statements

# Boolean Type and Boolean Operators
**Operators**
 - AND, OR NOT
 - Realational operators include:
>  - <, <=,>,>=,==,!=
 - Boolean operators:
>  - ! is not
>  - && is AND
>  - || is OR
>  - ^ exclusive or

 - & and | do no short circuit like the Boolean operators

#The Conditonal Operator
**?**
 - this is Javas only ternary operator(uses 3 arguments)
>  - y = (x > 0) ? 1: -1;
 - 

# Operator Precedence and Operator Associativity
**Associativity**
 - When 2 operators with the same precedence are evaluated, associativity determines the order of evaluation. all binary operators except assignment ops are left associative (left to right)

**Operator Precedence**
>  - Some operators execute before others
>  - Parentheses first
>  - postfix,prefix, and unary operators
>  - multiplication and division
>  - addition and subtraction
>  - bitwise operators
>  - logical operators
>  - ternary operator ?
>  - assignment operator

#Switch Case statement

**Switch Case**
 - Performed when we have a number of options that need a different task for each choice
 - Branch statement that ends each case with a break; or else itll fall through
 - The code block
> switch() {
>        case 1: (expression); break;
>        case 2: (expression); break;
>        default: (expression): break;
> }

## Iteration

**While**
 - repeatedly executes a target code bloack as long as a give boolean condition is true
 - You want it to iterate or it will infinitely loop
> int count  = 0;
> while (count < 100) {
> 	System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
> count ++;
> }

 - Sentinel value is a value that signifies the end of the loop

**do-while**
 - guarantees that the loop body will execute at least once

**for**
 - the for loop in Java iterates over the items in any sequence
 - arrays
 - strings
 - statements within a for loop will repeat until the entire sequence has been visited
 - 3 parts (initialization; continuation condition; action after each iteration);
>  - for (int i = 0; i <=10; i++)

 - often used to iterate through all elements in a collection
 - omittion the loop condition makes it implicity true 

**enhanced for**
 - for(T element: Collecetion onject/array)

**Which to use**
 - for loop is used if the number of repitition is known
 - while loop is used if repetitions is not known

**Loop Control Statements**
 - break: terminates the loop and transfers execution to the immediate statement
 - continue: causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediatley jump to the top of the loop
