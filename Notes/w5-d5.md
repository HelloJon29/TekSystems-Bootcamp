# Hibernate Mapping and Relationship Overview
 - Hibernate is an object relational mapping tool for java. It provides a framework for mapping an object oriented domain model(entity) to a relational database
 - Hibernate can treat entities as both object oriented classes and relational tables, and its possible to create relationships between entities 
 - the relationship(association) that can be established between entities:
>  - one-to-one
>  - one-to-many/many-to-one
>  - many-to-many
 - Each can be uni or bi directional, meaning either 1 can access or both can access the other entity

# Additional Annotations
**Cascading**
 - When one entity gets changed, so should the related entities
 - Cascading is done for this with types:
>  - All
>  - Persist
>  - Merge
>  - Remove
>  - Refresh
>  - Detach

**@ManyToOne**
 - 2 ways to do it: 
 - 1. using foreign key association
 - 2. use join table

**@OneToMany**
 - To have a One-to-Many association we need to have the dependency of a child class in a parent calss
 - Parent entity can have multiple child entities.
 - Hibernate allows use of Collection Type (List,Set,Map) to define multiple child entities
 - must create an intermediate table called Join Table that holds 2 foreign key columns, one fk refers to the source table, the other the target table
 - Having a unique foreign key in the target table means collection object cannot have duplicates. can implement with Set

**@OneToOne**
 - occurs when there is exactly 1 record in a table that corresponds to 1 record in a related table.
 - Both tables will contain the same number of records, and each row in the first table is linked to each row in the 2nd table
 - 3 ways to assign association:
>  - 1. Foreign key
>  - 2. Join table
>  - 3. Shared primary key

 - In OneToOne the default name of the foreign key column is the name of the entity and the name of the primary id of the source table. Example address_addressID

**ManyToMany**
 - occurs when one or more rows from one entity is associated with more than one row in another entity
 - Must create an intermediate table JoinTable that holds 2 foreign key columns.
 - No unique constraint for any of the 2 foreign key columns so many to many can work
 -
