# Week 1 Day 5

## SQL and using MariaDb/mySql Continued:

**EXTRA FUNCTIONS**
 - SELECT
 - FROM
 - WHERE
 - ORDER BY
 - SUM
 - LIMIT
 - You can nickname tables by adding a variable to it (AS)

**DATA: Persistence and Longevity**
 - Data Integrity: Keeps things strict, using Primary keys, not allowing incorrect info entered, not showing names as null etc.
 - RDBMS: Front end and back end for accessing and archiving data, can use front end to help enforce data integrity, but the best place to enforce is back end.

**Integrity Constraints**
 - Entity Integrity
> - 1. requires that each row of a table representing a unique entity, can be identified. Enforced with primary keys
> - 2. When primary key constraint is defined for a table, the db ensures that it is present(NOT NULL) and unique
> - 3. MARIA DB supports AUTO_INCREMENT keyword
> - 4. Unique constraint resembles primary key - all values for this field must be unique, no dupes.
 - Domain Integrity
> - 1. Domain: a specified sphere of activity or knowledge
> - 2. first application of domain integrity is a field's data type
> - 3. 
> - 4.
 - Referential Integrity
> - 1. Referential integrity is about enforcing the relationships between tables. Done with foreign key constraints
> - 2. the identifier(if present) must be unique in the database with Foreign key
> - 3. Foreign Keys define relationships between tables
> - 4. Foreign Keys constraints are enforced with DML statements(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). when a foreign key is INSERTED or UPDATED to a non NULL value, the db ensures the related primary key value actually exists. When the primary key with associated foreign keys is DELETED, the db takes action depending on how the foreign key was defined
> - 5. Deleting Primary Keys: cascade; set null; set default; no action;
 - User-defined Integrity
> - 1. Custom manner of defining constraints for field values
> - 2. CHECK constraint
> - 3.
