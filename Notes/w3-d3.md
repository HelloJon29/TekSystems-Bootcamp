##Week 3 Day 3 JAVA - METHODS,OBJECT MEMORY,

##Methods

#What they are
**What a method is**
 - named block of code
 - a method can be called (invoked) by name from other methods
 - can define 0 or more parameters
 - can optionally return a value, or no return is void
 - also called subroutines, subprograms, functions
 - organize code
 - reusable
 - methods have unique signatures based on name and parameters, not return type
 - always a member of a class

**Method declaration**
> public void autoFitColumn(int columnIndex) {}
> access return type method name (parameters)

**Access Specifier**
 - public: a method can be invoked by any consumer of the class
 - private means that the method can be invoked only from within the class
 - protected: means that the method can be invoked from within the class or any subclass of that class, can also be used default within a package
 - (default): can be invoked within a class or any other class in the same package

**Method Parameter Lists**
 - enclosed in parentheses
 - methods can declare 0 or more parameters
 - When methods have the same name, they MUST have unique paramters
 - 1. this technique is called overloading
 - 2. return type is irrelevant to signature

# Return Types
**Void**
 - all methods must declare a return type
 - if does not need to return a value, it returns void
 - if void is specified you cannot specify return value but it can use the statement.

**non-void Types**
 - If it is non void it must return a value of the same type
 - a method can return a type and automatically convert it to the return type

**Entry Point and Call Chain**
 - statements within a method do not execute unless the method is invoked(called)
 - the process starts when the main method is invoked by the JVM, the main method is the JVMs entry point
 - main method can invoke other methods, other methods can invoke other methods, this is a Call Chain

## JAVA Classes

#Object Oriented Programming
**OOP relies on Classes, Methods,variables**
# Java classes
**What they are**
 - Classes are the foundation of any working java app.
 - well designed classes represent reusable units of work
 - Classes and Objects are basic concepts of OOP which revolve around real life entities
 - class in Java is a logical template to create **objects** that share common properties and methods
 - Classes model real world, or imagination
 - We provide fields to hold data, getters/setters to provide access to data, and methods to work with the data. can provide notification of changes and contructors to initialize instances of the class.

**Class Declaration**
> public class Statistics {}
> can optionally have access specifier
> declared with class keyword
> names are alphanumeric but cant start with a number,Pascal case
> The body of the curly brackets

**Where do Objects come from**
 - an object is an instance of the class
 - Object acts as a variable of the class
 - class doesnt take memory space when its created, OBJECTS takes memory
 - INSTANTIATION: creating an instance, or create an object of a class
 - when an Object is created, they acquire the fields and methods defined on that class
 - Class has to be declared only once, Objects of the class can be declared several times
 - In Java, the **new** keyword is used to create objects
 - 1. Declaration: a variable declaration with a variable name with an object type
 - 2. Instantiation: the new keyword is used to create the object
 - 3. initialization: the new keyword is folled by a call to a constructor
 - EX:
> Scanner myScanner = new Scanner();

**Fields**
 - variables defined within a class are called fields or class variables
 - usually declare fields near the top of the class definition
 - fields can be accessed anywhere within class definiton (scope)
 - fields are automatically initialized
 - 1. numeric types are initialized to 0
 - 2. reference types are initialized to null
 - fields can be given access specifiers

**Composing Functionality**
 - Bring multiple classes together to accomplish the functional objectives of a application
 - many classes come from packages, either jdk, or by dev community.
 - some classes have utility for several apps

**Constructors**
 - constructors are special methods that are invoked only when an object is created using the **new** operator
 - constructors are similar to methods except:
 - 1. they have NO return type not even void
 - 2. they always have the same name as the class
 - 3. the cannot be directly invoked, except from another constructor
 - if a class does not declare any constructors the compliler will automatically generate a default constructor, public constructor that accepts no arguments
 - a class can declare multiple constructors as long as each constructor has a unique parameter list, constructor overloading

**Exposing State**
 - making fields public is a mistake, consumers could change the values
 - changing the values of the fields could make the object incorrect and inconsistent 
 - expose values of fields in read only fashion
 - You can use getter methods
 - this selective hiding of state variables is called encapsulation

**Getter methods**
 - Getter methods provide read only access

**this.**
 - this represents the current object
 - you should call other constructors directly to avoid duplication and maintenece issues

**Inheritance**
 - EXAMPLE
> A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles
> a square is a rectagle where the width and height is always the same
> given a square, you say a square is a rectangle

 - In OOP relationships are expressed through inheritance
 - A square class can inherit the Rectangle class by **extends** it
 - subclass inherits all members of superclass or base class
 - subclass can access all public and protected members
 - non defualt constructors are accessible but not inherited
 - invoking conststructor from a base class to a sub uses **super**

**Polymorphism**
 - if you Invoke a Class and set it to a different object, it will use the objects logic
> Rectangle rect = new Square(250.0);
> rect.setWidth(350.0);
> this will set both width and height according to the new Square objects logic

# Abstraction in Java

**Abstractions**
 - This is breaking down things into simpler terms
 - Squares and rectangles are Shapes
 - classes can be declared abstract
 - Abstract classes can have one or more methods declared but not implemented
 - cannot create instances of an abstract class (create an object)
 - we must extend abstract classes and implement the missing methods
> public abstract class Shape {
> 
>   public abstract double area();
>   public abstract double perimeter();
>   public abstract void draw();
> }
 - When extending the abstract class in another class you fill in the missing methods
 - you can override an abstract method, cant call the super method because it does not exist
 - @Override is an annotation that informs the compiler that a method is intended to override a method in a superclass
 - not required, but used often
 - the compiler will ensure that the method is in fact overriding a super method
 - insures safety net in case you or someone else change a method name in a superclass 
 - it alerts developers working on the code that it is an override
 - Abstract methods in an abstract class must have all its methods be used by the extending class

# The Object class

**Superclass of all Classes**
 - all Java classes are subclasses of OBJECT
 - This feature is built into the language
 - You dont need to explicitly extend Object
 - dont have to declare the methods either
 - The methods are inherited from Object
 - The Object Methods:
> boolean equals(Object other) returns true when other is equal to this, this will be overrided often. used by the Collection classes to test for object equality
> int hashCode() returns a hash code for the object, you should override this any time that you override equals
> Class<?>getClass() Returns an object, which represents the Class from which the object was defined. The Class object allows you to get meta-info about the class, such as what interface it implements, its constructors, what methods it declares. This allows specialized type of programming called reflection
> String toString() Returns a String representation of the object. You should overrid this whenever it is usefull

## Encapsulation
**New info**
- Classes are made of fields and methods, the skeleton
- methods contains the logic of your code
- variables contains the value of the code you can use

**Constructor**
 - Its a method used to initialize a class
 - allows you to pass values(variables) to a class when you instantiate it
 - Once again Scanner myScanner = new Scanner(System.in);

**Encapsulation**
 - in encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore it is also know as data hiding
 - a process that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse

**Static**
 - Static identifies a variable or method as belonging to the class rather than belonging to an instance of the class
 - you can call the method directly from the class with <.>
 - Math.Random() is an example of a static method. It exists in all of Math  at the class level and can be called directly without instantiating an object
 - modifying instatntiated variable only changes it for that instance
 - modifying static variable changes it for all instances
 - static methods like main can only call other static methods
 - youd want to use it when an instanced variable(class field) is not depended on

## Inheritance
**Inheritance**
 - Classes can inherit all of the variables and methods from another class
 - Original class is known as Parent or Super Class, new class is the subclass or child
 - Inheritance represents an IS-A reletionship
 - you can reuse variables and methods
 - child class can introduce completely new variables or methods
 - specify inheritance by extends keyword
 - java forces a class to have exactly one parent(single inheritance)
 - When you Instantiate a child class as Object from the Parent Class, it will only use methods from the parent class, not custom code from the child.

**Has-a relationship**
 - When one object contains another as a field variable
 - this is also known as a dependency
 - This is composition

**Overriding Parent Method**
 - subclasses can replace the logic of a parents method
 - overridden methods can be called from the parents type

**Super**
 - The super keyword is used to refer to the superclass(parent) of current class
 - Super can be used to refer to the parent class's methods, variables and constructors to call them
 - needed when there is a name conflict with current class
 - git status
