# Week 2 Day 2

## MariaDB Subprograms:
****
- PL/SQL subprograms are named PL/SQL blocks that can be invoked with a set of parameters.

**Stored Procedures**
 - Does not return a single value directly, mainly used to perform an action
 -  Reusable unit that encapsulates specific business logic of an app
 -  KEYWORDS:
>  -  CREATE PROCEDURE procedure name (parameter list)
>  -  CALL procedure name (arguments)
 - Parameters has one of 3 modes, IN, OUT, INOUT that precedes parameter name and data type
 - **NOTE: DELIMITER NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO DIFFERENCIATE ; AT THE END OF QUERIES THEN SET THE DELIMITER BACK TO ; AFTER THE END OF THE BLOCK**
 - Stored procedures can be as complicated as you want
 - DECLARE to start a variable

**Stored Functions**
 - Returns a single value, mainly used to compute and return a value
 - Used to encapsulate common formulas or business rules that are reusable among SQL statements or stored programs
 - similar structure as procedures but returns a single value always
 - MariaDB has 2 types of declarations for functions:
>  - DETERMINISTIC
>  - NOT DETERMINISTIC
 - The Structure:
> DELIMITER $$
> CREATE FUNCTION function_name(
>     param1,  param2,â€¦ )
> RETURNS datatype
> [NOT] DETERMINISTIC
> BEGIN
>  -- statements
> END $$
> DELIMITER ;

 - Cannot have a Transaction within a function

**Return Statements**

**Triggers**
 - Set of statements that run when an event occurs on a table
 - another way to check integrity
 - can be another way to run scheduled tasks
 - Events occur on a table when a row is INSERTED UPDATED OR DELETED, TRIGGERS can be before or after these events
 - The Structure:
>  CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
> 	AFTER INSERT
> 	   ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
> 	BEGIN
> 	   -- variable declarations
> 	   -- trigger code
> 	END;

## FLOW CONTROL STATEMENTS ##

** Conditional Statements **
 - IF: controls the flow of execution based on the outcome of a boolean expression
 - The structure:
> if condition then
> 	statements
> end if;
 - Can be chained with Else and ElseIF

 - CASE: chooses from a sequence of conditions and runs the correct statement
 - Has 2 forms, SIMPLE and SEARCHED

**LOOP STATEMENTS: **
 - 1. BASIC LOOP
> [begin_label:] LOOP
>    		statement_list
> 	END LOOP [end_label]

 - 2. WHILE LOOP
> [begin_label:] WHILE search_condition DO
>    		statement_list
> 	END WHILE [end_label]

 - 3. REPEAT
> [begin_label:] REPEAT
> 	    statement_list
> 	UNTIL search_condition
> 	END REPEAT [end_label]

## OPTIONAL NOTES ##

**CURSORS**
 - MARIADB supports cursors in stored procedures, functions, triggers
 - Cursors are optimized for performance, and for support read operations only
 - cursors work in a forward direction only
 - The workflow:
> DECLARE>OPEN>FETCH<>EMPTY?>CLOSE

**EXCEPTIONS**
 - Exceptions are run time errors that occur due to exceptional circumstances
 - Must declare a HANDLER: EXIT or CONTINUE
 - GET DIAGNOSTICS
 - SIGNAL and RESIGNAL (like a throw)
