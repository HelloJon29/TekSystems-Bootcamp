## Dependency Injection/ Inversion of Control

# Dependency Injection
 - creating dependencies are tightly coupled, and the object must be changed every time if you need different values, harder to unit test
 - DI is loose coupled, can change because it will implement an interface and doesn't care what class that implements that interface is added.
 - IoC is similar to DI

# Spring Bean Configuration
 - Annotation Based Configuration
 -  applicationContext is a "bag of beans" and is returned by the spring run method
 -  in the @SpringBootApplication you can pass (scanBasePackages) to component scan
 -  you can use @Import to get Configurations where @Bean is used to create beans. just pass in the class name with .class
 -
