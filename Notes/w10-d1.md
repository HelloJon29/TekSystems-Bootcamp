### Week 10 Day 1/2

### Spring

## Logging

# Logging Frameworks
 - Log4j
 - Logback
 - Tinylog
 - SLF4j(abstract)
 - Apache Commons logging(abstract)

# SlF4J Default Logging levels in spring boot
 - ERROR
 - WARN
 - INFO INFO
 - DEBUG DEBUG
 - TRACE TRACE

## Dependency Injection/ Inversion of Control

# Dependency Injection
 - creating dependencies are tightly coupled, and the object must be changed every time if you need different values, harder to unit test
 - DI is loose coupled, can change because it will implement an interface and doesn't care what class that implements that interface is added.
 - IoC is similar to DI

# Spring Bean Configuration
 - Annotation Based Configuration
 -  applicationContext is a "bag of beans" and is returned by the spring run method
 -  in the @SpringBootApplication you can pass (scanBasePackages) to component scan
 -  you can use @Import to get Configurations where @Bean is used to create beans. just pass in the class name with .class

**Annotation**
 - @Component
 - @Autowired
 - @Required
 - @Required
 - @Qualifier
 - @Resource
 - @Service
 - @Repository
 - @Controller
 - @Value
 - @Scope

# Different Ways to Dependency Inject
**Field Based DI**
 - Expensive
 - uses reflection to inject objects if no constructor and setter exists
 - harder to test

**Constructor Based DI**
 - The preferred way
 - Can pass another object as an object to be injected

**Setter Injection**
 - calls setter mehtods to instantiate beans

# Autowiring Dependencies 
**4 modes**
 - no
 - byName
 - byType
 - constructor

**Uses**
 - on fields
 - on setters
 - on constructors

# Scope of Beans
**The types of scopes**
 - Singleton: A single bean reference in memory will be made
 - Prototype: a new instance of bean is made each time.
 - Request
 - Session
 - Global-Session
