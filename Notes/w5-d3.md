### Week 5 Day 3

### Maven

## Maven Sang's slides

# What is Maven

 - Software project management tool
>  - building software is its primary function
 - Project Object Model (POM) based - pom.xml
>  - pom.xml maintains projects build, reporting a documentation
>  - POM can be inherited between parent and child project
 - Based on Convention over configuration principle
>  - Minimum configuration is needed
 - You specify what needs to be done not how it needs to be done
 - Plug-in architecture: Vibrant Maven Eco.system

# Maven's Objectives
**Making the build process easy**
 - Why waste time maintaining the build?
**Providing a uniform build system**
 - Why have each dev maintain their own build environment

**Providing Quality project information**
 - Why do extra work to get project info

**Provide guidelines for best practices development**
**Allowing transparent migration to new features**

# Maven Features
 - Simple project setup that follows best practices, gets started in seconds
 - Consistent usage across all projects means no ramp up time for new developers coming onto a project
 - Superior dependency management including auto updating, transitive, dependencies
 - Able to work with multiple projects at the same time
 - A large and growing repository of libraries and metadata to use out of the box, and arrangements in place with the largest Open Source projects for a real-time availability of their latest releases
 - Extensible with the ability to easily write plugins in java or scripting languages
 - Instant access to new features with little or no extra configuration
 - Maven wrapper -mvnw: Assures a correct Maven version is used per project

# What is POM file
 - Contains project info such as:
>  - what type of project
>  - project name
>  - project identity (coordinates)
>  - build customizations
>  - dependencies 
>  - plug-ins

**Project identity(artificat)**
 - Everything in maven is a project and every project has a unique identity
 - specified by project coordinates
 - Dependencies and parent references are described with their own project coordinates

**Coordinates**
 - groupId
 - artifactId
 - version

**Archetype**
 - the template, the original model
 - captures best practices

# Lifecycles
 - Default:
>  - validate
>  - compile
>  - test
>  - package
>  - integration-test
>  - verify
>  - install
>  - deploy

**REpository**
 - Maintains plugins and artifacts
 - defualt remote repositories maintain public plugins and artifacts maven central
 - Custom repositories can be set up to maintain non public plugins and artifacts
 - maven can easily locate artifacts both remote and local based on artifact coordinates
# Plugins
**Plugin Architecture**
 - Maven is based on Plugin architecture, all tasks are performed through plugins
 - Maven core is a shell, parses POM to find plugins needed and downloads them
 - Plugins are downloaded like dependencies
 - Plugins are Maven Projects with identities (coordinates)
 - downloaded plugin is then maintained in the local repository
 - Common plugins is used by everyone on a project
 - plugin can evolve/improve without breaking other parts of the build

**Maven Goal**
 - Goal is a unit of a task
 - ex generate compile test

**Plugins can be configured**
 - through configuration properties you can modify a plugin

# Transitive Dependencies
 - Maven handles dependency by downloading other dependencies  needed for you
 - Maven also handles conflicts between dependencies
 - mvn dependency:tree shows the tree of all the dependencies 

# Dependency Scope
 - each dependency is specified with scope

## Build Management Tools slide

# Advantages of using Maven
 - dependencies
 - convention over configuration
 - multiple repeated builds
 - automation
 - plugin management 
 - testing
 - development process
 - build status
 - consistent setups
 - standard and uniformed directory structure

# Maven Build Lifecycle
 - Clean
 - defualt
 - Site

## ORM, JPA - Java Persistence API, Hibernate

# JPA

**What is JPA**
 - Java Persistence API is the Java Object Relational Mapping (ORM) standard for storing, accessing, and managing java objects in a relational database
 - JPA is only a specification, it is not implementation, but several implementations are available, popular implementations include Hibernate, EclipseLink and Apache OpenJPA
 - JPA permits the developer to work directly with objects rather than with SQL statements. the JPA implementation is called a **Persistence provider**
 - JPA is the EE standard specification for ORM in Java EE
 - JPA API is a set of rules and framework to set interfaces for implementing **ORM**
 
# Object Relational Mapping
**What is ORM**
 - Object Relational Mapping is the concept process of converting data from object oriented language to relational database and vice versa
 - ORM translates the programming code attributes (variabls) to the columns in the table. it is good for managing various database operations such as insert update delete effectively
 - The mapping between object model and relational database should be as follows:
> (Class <-> Table)
> (Java Object <-> Row)
> (Class Attribute <-> Column)

 - ORM is a programming ability or approach to mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa
 - JPA is one possible approach to ORM By using jpa the developer can map store update delete and retrieve data from relational databases to java objects and vice versa

# Hibernate
**What is it**
 - Hibernate is an implementation of jpa and uses ORM techniques
 - Hibernate provides more features beyond what jpa specifies
 - It maps java classes to database tables and from java data types to SQL data types and relieves the developer from the majority of persistence related tasks.
 - Hibernate consists of several components like Hibernate ORM, Hibernate Search, Validator, Hibernate CGM, and hibernate tools

# Persistent Object
Persistent Objects:
 - Java classes whose objects or instances will be stored in a databases tables are called persistent classes in Hibernate. Hibernate works best if these classes follow some simple rules, also know as the POJO programming model
 - These are the main rules of persistent classes, not hard required:
 - All java classes that will be persisted need a default constructor
 - all classes should contain an ID in order to allow easy identification of objects within Hibernate and databases. this property is the primary key
 - all fields that will be persisted should be declared private and have getXXX and setXXX methods defined in the JavaBean style
 - proxies, all persistent class be either non final or implementations and interfaces declare all public methods

# Configuration object
# Session Factory object
 - SessionFactory is an interface, present in org.hibernate package
 - Configuration object is used to create SessionFactory object
 - thread safe used by all threads of an app
 - created on app start up and kept for later use

# Session object
 - Session is used to get physical connection with a database, Session is an interface, which is present in the org.hibernate package. A Session object is created based upon a SessionFactory object
 - A Session is designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database
 - usually not thread safe, create and destroy as needed
 - Session object is used to perform CRUD operations for instances of mapped entity classes. Instances may exist in the one of three states:
>  - Transient: not associated with any Session
>  - Persistent: associated with a unique Session
>  - Detached: previously persistent, not associated with Session

 - Session.save()
 - Session.update()
 - Session.merge()
 - Session.delete()
 - Session.remove()

# Transaction
 - Transaction enables you to achieve data consistency, and rollback in case something goes unexpected
 - Transaction is an interface
 - the methods:
 - void begin();
 - void commit();
 - void rollback();

# Query Object
**Query Interface**
 - Query is an interface that present inside org.hibernate package
 - a Query instance is called by Session.createQuery()
 - Query Objects use SQL or HQL strings to retrieve data from a database and create objects.

# What is Entity/POJO/Model Classes
 - Entity is a Java object that is going to be persisted. Entity classes are decorated with java annotations such as @Entity, @Id, @Table,@Column
 - Entites are nothing but beans or Models, they contain default constructor, setter and getter methods for the fields or private fields

# Hibernate App Stages
**Phase 1**
 - POJO Classes
 - Creating entities
 - DAO/Service classes containing service methods
 - example create upate delete
**Phase 2**
 - Mapping File: Hibernate Configuration
 - Configurations - Database connection info, schema level settings, entity mapping, using mapping file hibernate.properties or hibernate.cfg.xml
