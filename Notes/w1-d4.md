# Week 1 Day 4

## SQL and using MariaDb/mySql:

**5 types of SQL languages**
 - DDL: Data definition language
 - DML: Data Modification language
 - DQL: Data query language
 - TCL: Transaction control language
 - DCL: Data control language

**Use of MySql/MariaDB in CMD prompt**
 - Login: mysql -u root -p
 - Show databases in server: show databases;
 - Select database: use <name of db>;
 - show tables within db: show tables;

**Selecting data from databases DQL**
 - Select statements: SELECT <field> or <[field1, field2, field3]>
 - 1. Select * From <field> : precise selections, careful with use
 - 2. Select count(*) FROM: selects just the number of rows from a table (note: Queries that return a single value are Scalar queries)
 - WHERE <field or conditional> to select specific rows
 - DISTINCT: Selects only unique values

**INSERT DML**
 - INSERT [into(this is optional)]
 - Values
 - Can use SELECT with INSERT

**UPDATE DML**
 - UPDATE <field>
 - SET <values>
 - WHERE: Need to specify here or it will error or update everthing in the UPDATE field to the SET value

**DELETE DML**
 - DELETE
 - FROM <field>
 - WHERE: once again need to specify or it will error or delete everything in the field

**TRUNCATE DML**
 - TRUNCATE will delete all rows, the preferred method to do this instead of DELETE FROM

**Transactions**
 - rollback: is usually executed within a procedure's exception handler
 - commit: is issued after all statements succesffuly execute
 - start: syntax is vendor specific. Oracle also supports savepoints

**CREATE DDL**

**ALTER DDL**
 - under alter, you can: 
 - 1. add
 - 2. drop
 - 3. modify
 - Note about changing schemas: The version of software and schema both need to be updated and saved with version control
 - rename:

**DCL creating granting and revoking**
 - create user <name> identified by <'server'>;
 - grant select, update, insert on *.* to 'name';
 - revoke insert on *.* from
