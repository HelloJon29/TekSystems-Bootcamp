# Week 2 Day 1

## SQL and using MariaDb/mySql PART 3:

**Quick Notes From earlier**
 - Use JOIN with <ON> keyword to attach keys from tables
 - You can have custom SELECT constraints after a <,> Like a CASE statement
 - CASE is formatted as:
>  - CASE xx WHEN xx THEN xx END (can continue with when statements forever, can end with ELSE)

## String functions ##

**REPLACE() function**
 - replaces a string column 

**TRIM() function**
 - (BOTH, LEADING, TRAILING)

**COUNT**
 - COUNT(*) will count rows that include null
 - COUNT(field name) will exclude null values
 - GROUP BY WILL BE USED TYPICALLY WITH COUNT

**MAX(), MIN() usually a math function**
 - selecting max or min from empty resultset returns a NULL

## Numeric/Math functions ##

**SUM()**
 - calculates the sum of a set of values
 - NULL values are ignored
 - Needs to be used with WHERE or GROUP BY

**AVG()**

**MOD() or MODULUS**

**ROUND()**
 - ROUND(n,d) where n is number given, d is the decimal placement to round
 - defaults to 0

**TRUNCATE()**

**CURRENT_DATE()**
 - numeric use will return YYYYMMDD format
 - String use will return YYYY-MM-DD format
 - Side note: To keep from having unpredictable outcomes from users and the server, we use EPOCH(The number of time in seconds since midnight jan 1 1970) for consistency.

**MONTH(date)**
 - Gives a month portion from a date in number 1-12

**DATEDIFF()**
 - Gives the difference of to given dates

**IF()**
- If statement formated as
- IF(Condition,True,False)

**CAST()**
- CAST converts data types to declared type
- CAST(4+6 AS UNSIGNED);

**LOGICAL OPERATORS**

**ARITHMETIC OPERATORS**

**BITWISE OPERATORS**

**Comparison Operators**

**IS Null and IS NOT NULL**

**IN OPERATOR**
- IN works like OR statements
- ex WHERE country IN ('USA', 'FRANCE');
- ADV EX: SELECT* FROM customers WHERE country IN(SELECT Country FROM suplliers);

## SubQueries ##

**What are Subqueries**
 - They are SQL SELECT statements nested within another SQL statement
 - Also called an inner Query or Inner select
 - goes within SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
 - Inner queries always execute first
 - 3 different types:
>  - Scaler sub queries
>  - Row sub queries
>  - Table sub queries
 - EX:
>  select checkNumber, amount from payments
> 	where amount(select avg(amount) from payments);

**Subqueries vs Joins**
 - Recommended to use JOIN over sub queries for performance reasons
 - Subqueries should only by used if JOIN cannot be used
 - JOINS are not as easy to read as subqueries, where subqueries are more dynamic

**Subqueries with HAVING**
 - HAVING must be used with GROUP BY as it filters by groups
 - EX:
> SELECT column_name(s)
>    FROM table_name_1
>    WHERE condition
>    GROUP BY column_name(s)
>   HAVING Aggregate_function(column_name)   expression_operator{=,<,>}
>                (SELECT column_name(s) from table_name_2);

**Subqueries with FROM**
 - used to specify the source from which data has to be fetched.
 - You must use an alias

**Correlated Subqueries**
 - you can reference tables from outer tables
 - executed once for every row in the outer query, leading to bad performance
> SELECT productname, buyprice
> 	FROM products p1
> 	WHERE buyprice (
> 		SELECT AVG(buyprice)
> 		FROM products
> 		WHERE productline = p1.productline);

**Subqueries with DML**
 - INSERT EX:
> INSERT into employeeBackup (SELECT * FROM employees);
 - UPDATE EX:
UPDATE orders SET status=’Backorder’ 
> WHERE status=’In Process’ AND orderNumber IN (
> 	SELECT DISTINCT od.orderNumber 
> 	FROM orderDetails od JOIN products p USING(productCode)
> 	WHERE p.quantityInStock<10);
 - DELETE EX:
> DELETE FROM cart WHERE customerNumber IN (
> 	SELECT DISTINCT customerNumber FROM (
> 		SELECT customerNumber, MAX(orderDate) FROM orders 
> 		GROUP BY customerNumber
> 		HAVING MAX(orderDate) < date_sub(now(), interval 3 year)) outdated);
