### Week 9 Day 4

### Spring

## Spring Slide 1 cont(slide 29 on

# Issues with Spring
 - Deep learning curve due to similar configurations that have to be manually applied
 - Spring architecture has become complex
 - need to specify frameworks to use, select compatible versions.
 - the fix was spring boot

# Spring Boot
 - Built on top of Spring Framework
 - Provides a easier way to setup and build a sping project
 - Can start with minimal to no configuration
 - No XML requirement
 - Opinionated view of building production ready apps, community put together best practices
**Spring boot embedded Containers**
 - spring web ships with tomcat
 - can change dependency to jetty or undertow
 - must exclude tomcat from spring web dependency first to change

**4 major components**
 - Spring boot starters
 - Spring boot autoConfigurator
 - spring boot cli
 - spring boot actuator

**Spring Web Starter**
 - Web MVC
 - Jackson: json building 
 - Validation
 - Embedded Servlet Container: default tomcat shipped
 - Logging: default logback, log4j, slf4j

# Spring Bean Configuration
**Different ways to Configure Beans**
 - Annotation Bean Configuration: Uses Component scan and searches and creates all beans through annotation
 - Java Based Configuration: Has Bean annotation inside of configuration classes to create Beans

# Actuator
 - Add spring.boot.starter.actuator to POM
 - need to specify what endpoints are available
 - by default info and health are available

#Spring Boot ServletInitializer
 - SpringBootServletInitializer is an interface, binds servlet, filter, ServletContextInitializer beans from application context to the server
 - WAR file will do this for you

# Project Lombok
 - Lombok is a library that helps minimize code
 - Replaces boilerplate code with annotations
 - Getter and Setters can be replaced with simple @Getter and @Setter annotations
 - Also reduces constructors, hashcode, equals, toString
 - @Data will do toString,EqualsandHash, Getter, Setter, Required Args constructor in one annotation

## Spring Boot Anotations

# Important annotations
**Spring MVC**
 - Controller
 - RequestMapping
 - GetMapping
 - PostMapping
 - PutMapping
 - PatchMapping
 - DeleteMapping
 - ModelAttributes

**Spring REST**
 - RestController
 - RequestParam
 - PathVariable
 - ResponseBody
 - RequestBody

# Mapping
 - Mapping can be at Class level or method level or Both
 - using at both levels will reduce the url in the method mappings
 - GetMapping,PostMapping etc are shortcuts for the RequestMapping variants

# Rest
 - Representational State Transfer
 - A stateless client-server
 - Consists of 2 components Rest Server, Rest Client
 - RESTful apps generate HTTP requests performing CRUD on resources
 - RESTful apps return data in JSON or XML format

**Five constraints**
 - Client-Server
 - The interface(URL) is uniform and exposing resources
 - the service is stateless
 - the service results should be Cacheable(http cache)
 - Service should assume a layered architecture. Client should not assume direct connection to server

**Response Body**
 - Instead of html, a body will be automatically made and read out in JSON

**Request Body**
 -
