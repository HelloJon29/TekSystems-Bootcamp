### Week 6 Day 2

### JUNIT CONT

## Intro to JUNIT 5

# What is Unit Test?
 - Tests a single unit of work
 - basically a method
 - does not depend on completion of other tasks
 - Goals:
>  - Verify application works
>  - Find bugs as early as possible
>  - pieces work before putting together
 - works with Annotations ex @BeforeAll @Test @AfterAll

# Annotations
 - @BeforeAll: executes before anything else in the class, used to setup
 - @Test: this includes the testing method and the implementation
 - @BeforeEach
 - @Disabled
 - @Timeout
**Methods**
 - Assert.assertEquals(expected,tested)
 - assertThrows() 

# Test Methods
 - Test methods should be public and are always void
 - Private methods cannot be called and therefore cannot be tested outside of the class containing the method. They can be tested indirectly via a public method, a method calling the private method
 - Protected methods can be tested if you name the package the same as the package that the method comes from
