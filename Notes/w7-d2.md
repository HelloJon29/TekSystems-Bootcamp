### Week 7 Day 2

### Javascript

## Javascript basics / Sangs slides

# What is JS?
 - Scripting language: lightweight
 - Used to add interactivity to HTML pages
 - Could be embedded into HTML pages or referenced from a seperate file

# What can JS do?
 - Put dynamic text into HTML
 - react to events
 - can read and write HTML elements
 - can be used to validate input data
 - can be used to detect the browser type and version
 - can be used to detect whether a browser supports features or not
 - can be used to animate html elements

# How to inject JS code into HTML
**Embed**
 - use script tag with type attribute
 - Scripts can be in either head or body
 
**External**
 - can be provided locally or remotely
 - use the src attribute within script tag

# JS Variables
 - you can create a variable with or without var keyword(recommended to use it)
 - Variable names are case sensitive
 - variable names bust begin with a letter, $, or underscore
 - you can declare a variable without assigining it, its type is undefined

# JS Scope
 - The variable scope is aligned with a function unlike java code blocks
**Global Variable Scope**
 - defined outside a function
 - all functions on same page can access
 - prone to overrides accidents

**Local scope variable**
 - When you declare a variable with var and within a function, the variable can only be accessed within that function
 - Important that if you dont use var it is assumed as a global variable

# Statements
 - statements are instructions to be executed, often called JS code
 - Semicolons separate js statements, optional
 - Conditional if, if else, switch exists
 - loops exist
 - try catch
 - throw

# Code Blocks
 - statements can be grouped together in a code block in {} like java
 - most common form is a function/method

# Function
 - Js procedure: set of statements
 - can take 0 or more named parameters
 - the return statement can be used to return a value at any time, terminates function

**Definitions**
 - can be defined by function statement, expression, constructor(rare)
 - when function is declared, internally a function object is created, that is assigned to a property of the owning object
 - The owning object of the top level function is window for browsers
 - even though we write statements in a function, it is still declared and not executed like java
> function statement:
> function myFunction() {}
> function expression: can be anonymous
> tellSomething : function(optional name) {}

**Function as a method**
 - Property of a js object whose value is a function object is called a method

**Function Invocation**
 - you must manually invoke functions
 - can do this by assigning it to a variable

# Data Types
 - JS is a loosely typed or dynamic type language
 - dont have to declare variable type
 - you can use the sam variable names as different types automatically

**all types**
- 6 primitive types
- boolean, null, undefined, number, String, Symbol: immutable
- Object type

# Object as Hash
 - JS objects are essentially hash with property-name/value pairs
 - property name must be unique
 - like a Map in java
 - no exception to this rule

# 3 Ways of Creating object
 - 1. create an object instance as Hash literal: preferred 
 - 2. Define a function as a constructor first and then create an instance of an object from it
 - 3. create a direct instance of an object by using built in constructor of the built in "Object" object

## JS slide 1

# What is JS
 - safe programming language. Does not provide low level access to memory or cpu, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it

# What cant JS do
 - js abilities in the browser is limited for the sake of the users safety
 - examples are :
 - 1. JS on a webpage may not read/write or copy files on hard disk, or execute programs, no direct access to OS functions
 - 2. modern browsers allow it to work with files, but limit the access
 - 3. ways to interact with camera/mic but requires permission
 - 4. Same Origin policy, js will not interact with tabs from another domain or website. It only has access to the same domain and tabs related
 - 5. 

# Variables
 - declare with var, let, const
 - var and let create an object
 - almost everything is an object in js
 - let cannot be redeclared, must be declared first, must have a block

# Operators
- == checks value only regardless of data type
- === checks value and data type

## JS basics slide 2

# function
 - function is a block of code that is defined once and can be invoked any number of times

**how to call/invoke after definition**
 - just call the name and pass in arguments if any

**Return**
 - when a function is defined, return type of the function must also be defined. 

# Scope
 - Global variables are outside of functions, and can have var or let but those are optional
 - Local are inside of functions and must have var or let or it will default to global scope variables

# Hoisting
 - hoisting is moving the declaration of object to the top of the code
 - js will trust that the devloper will declare it later or else it will error
 - if you do the declaration first then nothing will print because the code is undefined, not even null.
