### Javascript

## DOM (Document Object Model)

# The HTML DOM
 - DOM is an interface that allows programs to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document
 - defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated
 - JS provides DOM class that defines HTML elements as **objects**, supports properties, methods, events, which are available for manipulating and creating web pages organized into objects. accessible through modern browsers.

**DOM tree**
 - the html file can be viewed as a tree starting at the doc type then html tag, then branch to head and body and then each element of both

**DOM node**
 - node is a generic name for any type of object in the DOM hierarchy
 - node is simply an element

# Selecting Document Elements
 - Dom defines several ways to select elements
>  - Document/Html object collections
>  - an id attribute (ID should be unique per document)
>  - name attribute
>  - a tag name
>  - css class or classes
>  - css selector expression

**Selecting**
 - querySelector() will select the first element that matches the css expression
 - querySelectorAll() will select all elements that match the css expression

# Document Structure and traversal
 - move up and down the dom tree branch to branch with parent, child, and sibling properties
 - parentNode, childNodes[node number], firstChild, lastChild, nextSibling, previousSibling

**Root node**
 - the document object is the root of every node in a DOM
 - document is a property of the window object
 - head and body are properties of the document object

**Parent Node**
 - The parent is any node one above another
 - you can chain and obtain the ancestor nodes

**Child node**
 - firstChild will select elements, text, or comments first where firstChildElement will only grab an element

**InnerHTML**
 - easiest way to get contents of an element
 - it is a property
 - used for getting or replacing content of HTML elements, including head and body

# Changing a DOM
 - document type defines methods for creating element and text objects
 - node type defines methods for inserting, deleting, and replacing nodes in a tree

**Inserting nodes into DOM**
 - appendChild(), insertBefore() are used to add items to the beginning middle or end of a parent element
 - replaceChild() is used to replace an old node with a new one

**Create new nodes**
 - createElement()
 - createTextNode()

**Remove Nodes**
 - removeChild()

**Modify styles**
 - the style property represents the inline styles on an HTML element
 - one way to edit a style is setAttribute()
 - this removes all existing inline styles from the element

# Events
 - events are actions that take place in the browser that can be initiated by either the user or the browser itself
 - events are normally used in combo with function, functions will not be executed before the event occurs

**Event Handlers**
 - event handlers are a block of code that will execute when the event occurs
 - 3 ways to assign events to elements
 - 1. Inline event handlers
 - ex: function focusevent() { document.getElementById("input1").style.background="red";}
 - 2. event handler properties
 - 3. event listeners

**Mouse Events**
 - onclick
 - onmouseover
 - onmousemove
 - onmoueseenter
 - onmouseleave

**Form events**
 - onsubmit()
 - onfocus()
 - onblur()
 - onchange()

**Keyboard events**
 - keydown
 - keypress : excludes keys that dont produce a character shift alt delete etc
 - keyup
 - KeyCode : produces ascii value of key pressed
 - Key : shows the value of key pressed
 - Code : shows the physical key being pressed
