##Week 2 Day 5 JAVA

#Intro to Java Basics

**Why Java**
 - Java is a general purpose language
 - Concurrent
 - class-based
 - object oriented
 - specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible
 - WORS: Write once, run anywhere
 - compiled java code can run on all platforms that support java without the need for recompilation
 - Java is an internet language
 - In games, web services, mobile phones, and businesses
 - Hadoop framework and ElasticSearch are both writtin in java and used in Big Data projects

**Java History**
 - 5 primary goals in creation of JAVA
> It must be simple, object orientated, familiar
> It must be robust and secure
> it must be architecture neutral and portable
> it must execute with high performance
> it must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic
 - James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and patrick Naughton initiated Java in June 1991. Sun microsystems or Green team
 - Green Project chanced to OAK
 - 1994 Oak was renamed to java and released in 1995
 - java 1.0 released in January 23, 1996

**Features**
 - Simple
> It is derived from C and C++. Java removed pointers 
> Introduced Garbage Collector, for memory management
> common program model for multi plat

 - Object Oriented
> Inherently object oriented
> This allows great flexibiltiy, modularity, clarity, inheritance, and polymorphism

 - Distributed
> Involves several computers working together on a network
> Designed to make this easy
 - JIT Compiled
> The compiler first converts source code to byte code, portable binary format, which can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
> JVM compiles byte code to Just IN TIME to machine code appropriate to the machine where the JVM is running it
 - Robust
> Can detect many problems that would first show up at execution in other languages
> elminates certain types of error prone constructs
> runtime exception handling for support
 - Secure
> implements several security mechanisms
 - Architecture Neutral
> JVM will allow you to write programs that are multi plat
 - Portable
> can be run on any platform without being recompiled
 - Multithreaded
> multi thread programming is smoothly integrated in java
 - Dynamic
> designed to adapt to evolving evironment
> new code can be loaded on the fly

**Architecture**
 - Java Development Kit:
>  - A software development environment used for developing java apps.
>  - Includes JRE, an interpreter/loader(JAVA), a compiler JAVAC, and archiver JAR. DOCUMENTS JavaDoc
 - Java runtime Environment:
>  - Aka Java RTE
>  - provides minimum for executing a java application
>  - includes JVM core classes and supporting files
 - Java Virtual Machine:
>  - Manages system memory and provides a portable execution environment
>  - Specification: where requirements of a JVM are specified
>  - Implementation: a program that meets the reuirements of the JVM specification
>  - Runtime Insatance: whenever a java command is written on command prompt to run a java class, an instance of JVM is created
**Editions of JDK**
 - Java standard Edition(SE) client side standalone apps, desktop
 - Java Enterprise Edition (EE) server side apps
 - Java Micro Edition(ME)/DEFUNCT
 - JAVA FX used to create internet apps with a lightweight user interface api
**Popular IDEs**
- Netbeans
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Eclipse
- JDeveloper
- Android Studio
- Visual Studio Code

**Compiling in terminal**
>  - javac is the compiler command
>  - javac Welcome.java will compile the file and produce the bytecode
>  - then you can just call java Welcome

**Anatomy of Java programs**
 - Class name
>  - every program must have at least one class
>  - each class has a name(starts uppercase)
 - main method
>  - In order to run a class it must contain a method named main
>  - main is the entry point for the JVM
 - statements
>  - represents an action or sequence of actions
 - statement terminator
>  - every statement in java ends with a <;>
 - reserved words
>  - they cannot be used as variables because they are apart of the Java syntax.
>  - examples include public, class, static
 - curly braces and block
>  - a pair of curly braces forms a block that groups statements
>  - curly braces are always paired
 - comments
>  - use // or /* for multi lines
>  - keep in mind these should be short and to the point with minimal to no updating needed
 - blocks

**Naming Conventions**
 - Classes:
>  - should be Upper CamelCase
 - packages:
>  - lowercase, split by a <.> for project names and other layers
 - Methods and Variables:
>  - lower Camelcase
>  - use verbs to describe methods
>  - use short names for temp variables like i or x
>  - Constants should be all UPPER
 - Interfaces:
>  - Names should be written in UPPER CamelCase, tend to have a name that describes the operation of the class

# Java Programming Fundamentals

**Variable Declaration/memory allocation**
 - to declare a variable:
> <data type> <name of variable>;

 - to assign a value to that variable:
> <name of variable> = <a value or expression>;

**Reading Input From the Console**
 - you can use Scanner object (a java utility level type/class) to get input from users
> Scanner <name of scanner> = new Scanner(System.in);
> sout ("enter an integer: ");
> int i = input.nextInteger();
> This is also how you can create your own functions(methods) to be called
**Identifiers**
 - a sequence of characters that has letters,digits,underscores, and dollar signs
 - must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
 - cannot be reserved word
 - cant containt true,false,null
 - can be any character length
 - values assigned to a declared variable must be the same format as the data type of the variable
 - CONSTANTS are usually where you use <final>
**Data types**
 - Primitive types: byte(0), short(0), int(0), long(0L),float(0.0f), double(0.0), boolean, char
 - Non-primitive/Reference: String, Array, Class(class can be any name too, like Scanner or BigDecimal) 

 - Reference Data Types (Classes):
>  - memory depends on definition of the class
>  - memory to store objects is allocated in an area called the heap
>  - variables for reference types point to the heap

**Scanner**
 - popular uses of scanner type
> Scanner sc1 = new Scanner(InputStream input);
> Scanner sc2 = new Scanner(File file);
> Scanner sc3 = new Scanner(String str);

**Literals**
 - A literal is any number, text, or other info that directly represents a value
 - it is not a value of any type that we read from the console, file, or other info sources
 - Literal is what we type being what we get
> ex: int radius = 20; 20 being the literal

 - integer literals are the number given itself
 - long literals is a value ended with L
 - double is a decimal literal
 - float literals are ended with F
 - char literals are enclosed in single quotes
 - \ is an escape sequence with many uses like \n for new line
 - unicode characters:
>  - char ch = '\u0061'; this is unicode for 'a'
 - a String is an object not a primitive
>  - any sequence of characters in double quotes is a string literal
>  - String literals are first-class objects, they have access to all methods defined by the String class
>  - ex String user = "pop".concat("corn") //prints popcorn

 - boolean is true or false literals

**Relational**
 - == is asking if 2 variables are pointing to the same object rather than if the values themselves is the same
 - instanceOf checks whether a variable is of the correct type in boolean
 - && AND returns true if both conditions are true
 - || OR returns true if one condition is true
 - | Bitwise OR if either bits is 1 it gives 1, otherwise 0

**Unary Operators**
 - Unary Minus ex -a returns negative value
 - Unary Plus maintains the current sign
 - ++ increments by 1
 - -- decrements by 1
 - ! NOT operator
**Ternary Operator**
 - shorthand for if else statement with 3 operands
>  - conditional ? exprTrue : exprFalse;
**Floating**
 - Floating Point Arithmetic returns approximated numbers because they cant be stored with perfect precision

**Type Conversion**
 - numeric conversion
 - type casting
 - Widening or auto type conversion
 - Narrowing or explicit type conversion
 - Type promotion rules
>  - All byte, short and char values are promoted
>  - Promotion to int is the default behavior except:
>  - 1. if any operand is a long, the whole expression is promoted to long
>  - 2. if any operand is a float the entire expression is promoted to float
>  - 3. if any operand is a double the result is a double

**Formatting floating point numbers**
 - String.format() method
 - DecimalFormat class
