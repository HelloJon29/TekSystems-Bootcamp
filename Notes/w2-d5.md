##Week 2 Day 5 JAVA

#Intro to Java Basics

**Why Java**
 - Java is a general purpose language
 - Concurrent
 - class-based
 - object oriented
 - specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible
 - WORS: Write once, run anywhere
 - compiled java code can run on all platforms that support java without the need for recompilation
 - Java is an internet language
 - In games, web services, mobile phones, and businesses
 - Hadoop framework and ElasticSearch are both writtin in java and used in Big Data projects

**Java History**
 - 5 primary goals in creation of JAVA
> It must be simple, object orientated, familiar
> It must be robust and secure
> it must be architecture neutral and portable
> it must execute with high performance
> it must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic
 - James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and patrick Naughton initiated Java in June 1991. Sun microsystems or Green team
 - Green Project chanced to OAK
 - 1994 Oak was renamed to java and released in 1995
 - java 1.0 released in January 23, 1996

**Features**
 - Simple
> It is derived from C and C++. Java removed pointers 
> Introduced Garbage Collector, for memory management
> common program model for multi plat

 - Object Oriented
> Inherently object oriented
> This allows great flexibiltiy, modularity, clarity, inheritance, and polymorphism

 - Distributed
> Involves several computers working together on a network
> Designed to make this easy
 - JIT Compiled
> The compiler first converts source code to byte code, portable binary format, which can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
> JVM compiles byte code to Just IN TIME to machine code appropriate to the machine where the JVM is running it
 - Robust
> Can detect many problems that would first show up at execution in other languages
> elminates certain types of error prone constructs
> runtime exception handling for support
 - Secure
> implements several security mechanisms
 - Architecture Neutral
> JVM will allow you to write programs that are multi plat
 - Portable
> can be run on any platform without being recompiled
 - Multithreaded
> multi thread programming is smoothly integrated in java
 - Dynamic
> designed to adapt to evolving evironment
> new code can be loaded on the fly

**Architecture**
 - Java Development Kit:
>  - A software development environment used for developing java apps.
>  - Includes JRE, an interpreter/loader(JAVA), a compiler JAVAC, and archiver JAR. DOCUMENTS JavaDoc
 - Java runtime Environment:
>  - Aka Java RTE
>  - provides minimum for executing a java application
>  - includes JVM core classes and supporting files
 - Java Virtual Machine:
>  - Manages system memory and provides a portable execution environment
>  - Specification: where requirements of a JVM are specified
>  - Implementation: a program that meets the reuirements of the JVM specification
>  - Runtime Insatance: whenever a java command is written on command prompt to run a java class, an instance of JVM is created
**Editions of JDK**
 - Java standard Edition(SE) client side standalone apps, desktop
 - Java Enterprise Edition (EE) server side apps
 - Java Micro Edition(ME)/DEFUNCT
 - JAVA FX used to create internet apps with a lightweight user interface api
**Popular IDEs**
- Netbeans
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Eclipse
- JDeveloper
- Android Studio
- Visual Studio Code

**Compiling in terminal**
 - javac is the compiler command
 - javac Welcome.java will compile the file and produce the bytecode
