### Week 11

### Web Services

## SOAP and REST

# What are Web Services
 - Web services are client and server applications that communicate over HyperText Transfer Protocol(HTTP) to connect, interoperate and exchange data messages.

# Characteristics of Web services

# Architecutre
 - Provider: creates the web service and makes it available to client app who want to use it. Each provider must decide which services to expose, how to make trade offs between security and easy availability, how to price the services, or how to exploit free services for other vaule
 - Requestor: the client app that needs to contact the web service
 - Broker: AKA service registry, responsible for making the web service interface and implementation access info available to any potential service requester.

# Types of Web Services
 - SOAP: old outdated, Simple Object Access Protocol
 - REST: Representational State transfer

# Types of Web Service APIs
 - Jax-ws(SOAP)
 - Jax-rs(REST)

# What is Rest
 - Restful apps generate HTTP requests performing CRUD ops on resources
 - RESTFul apps return data in JSON or XML

# Soap overview
 - WSDL is an xml doc that describes the sturcture to SOAP based web service
 - WSDL definition is divided into seperate sections that specify the logical interface and the physical details of a web service
 - physical details include both endpoint info, http port number, binding information, which specifies how the SOAP payload is represented and which transport is used

# SOAP Approaches 
 - Contract-Last
 - Contract-First

# Spring-WS ARCH
 - Spring-WS Core
 - Spring-WS Support
 - Spring-WS Security
 - Spring XML
 - Spring OXM

# Important Annotations
 - @PostConstruct: used for methods to execute after a bean is created
 - @EndPoint: Spring-WS annotation registers the class with Spring WS as a potential candidate for processing incoming SOAP messages
 - @PayloadRoot: used by SPring WS to pick the handler method based on the messages namespace and localPart.
 - @ResponsePay
